The developer describes the game as a chaotic looter-shooter set on the war-torn planet of Kairos. Borderlands 4 takes the fast-paced gunplay of the series and expands it into a seamless open world with new traversal options like grappling, gliding, swimming, and wall-running. Unlike Borderlands 3’s segmented planets, Kairos is one continuous sandbox filled with dangerous biomes, hidden loot, and endless firefights. Players can customize weapons through a new Licensed Parts system with billions of unique combinations, making every gun feel personal. RPG depth has also been reworked with layered skill trees that allow hybrid builds, including ranged perks like Ricochet Rounds or Overwatch drones that redefine combat strategy. Endgame is built directly into the world, with replayable bosses, weekly challenge missions, and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. Borderlands 4 brings back the humor and chaos fans love while refining loot progression, exploration, and replayability.

Hi all and welcome back. Today I'm checking in  on Borderlands 4, 6 weeks after launch to see   what's changed, what's improved, and what still  needs work. Gearbox has pushed several major   patches since release. So, let's go over what the  experience is like now. Borderlands 4 launched   on September 12th, and the first week was rough.  PC players ran into constant stutters and shader   hitches, while consoles lacked comfort options  like FOV sliders and motion blur toggles. For me,   it was playable, but I seem to have been the  exception. Lucky me. Since then, Gearbox has   released multiple patches focused on stability,  mission fixes, and balance. And while some   problems remain, the overall experience finally  feels stable. Let's start with performance. The   biggest change players are noticing seems to be  smoother traversal. That early shader hitch, the   small freeze every time you entered a new area, is  less common now. The game preloads shaders faster,   which means sprinting or driving through new  terrain, doesn't stutter as often as before. Load   times appear shorter, GPU spikes less frequent,  and for many PC setups, frame pacing feels more   stable overall. It's still not perfect. Some  players continue to report micro stutters in   dense city zones or during heavy co-op fights,  but compared to launch, it's a noticeable step   forward. My own experience has been good enough,  though, I still had to adjust a few settings early   on, which really shouldn't have been necessary.  I'm now running the game on maximum settings and   it performs reasonably well most of the time.  There's still work to be done, but for most   setups, stability finally feels closer to where  it should be. Gearbox also fixed a long list   of mission and progression bugs that were soft  locking players. NPCs that failed to spawn now   appear properly. Fast travel stations save their  unlocks, and quests no longer reset after death.   The rankup missions that didn't register  progression are working again, and co-op   sessions no longer desync when one player loads  faster than the other. In short, the campaign now   flows the way it should have from day one. On the  loot and reward side, there's been real progress.   The lost loot machine finally works properly.  It prioritizes rare gear and lets you sell   items directly, so no more pointless gray gear  cluttering it up. Gearbox also lowered the respect   cost from 5,000 iridium to 1,500, making it much  easier to experiment with builds without feeling   punished. Cash drops and vending prices have  been rebalanced, and world bosses now scale loot   correctly to your level. Still, some players say  drop rates feel a little stingy and the nerf to   crit knives hit melee builds harder than expected.  So, while the economy is better, tuning is still   ongoing. The balance patches have been a major  focus. Vault Hunters received buffs across the   board. Harlo's elemental builds now stack damage  correctly. Rafa's melee tree has better sustain.   and Aean's cooldown loop was tweaked to make  hybrid builds more viable. The siren's abilities   also improved, faster charge recovery and cleaner  dot scaling, which makes her smoother to play   overall. Community feedback is mostly positive,  though some minmax players feel that a few of   the newer nerfs, especially around lateg game crit  weapons, made certain high damage builds less fun.   Gearbox has said they're continuing to monitor  stats and plan further adjustments over time. Then   there's UI and controls. One of the biggest wins  for console players is the addition of a full FOV   slider, something missing at launch. Weapon wheels  no longer get stuck, and controller support for   abilities like air dash and skill triggers feels  tighter. Inventory filters finally save between   sessions, too, so you don't have to redo your  sorting every single time. That's a big quality of   life fix. The UI can still feel clunky, but it's a  noticeable improvement. Co-op lobbies load faster,   and the interface no longer lags when swapping  gear or comparing items. These are small fixes   individually, but together they make the game  feel much more responsive. Visuals and audio also   received quiet but noticeable upgrades. Lighting  in darker indoor areas is adjusted. Cutscene pop   and reduced. And environmental effects look  sharper overall. Audio balancing improved as   well. Dialogue syncing is better. Voice lines  repeat less often. And combat music transitions   more naturally between fights. It still has that  loud, over-the-top Borderlands energy, but it's   more consistent and less messy to play moment to  moment. Post-launch support has also been steady.   Gearbox started rolling out short limited events  between major updates. Small bursts of content   meant to keep players active while larger DLCs are  in the works. So, even if you finish the story,   it's clear they plan to keep adding things rather  than letting the game go quiet between expansions.   So, where does Borderlands 4 stand now? Simply  put, it's in a much better place for most players.   The technical problems that dominated launch week  are largely fixed, though still not perfect. The   core loop feels smoother thanks to all the quality  of life changes. There's still tuning to do,   especially around performance and balancing, but  the experience overall is finally consistent,   and it might be worth jumping in if you've  been waiting for stability. That was it. If   you like videos that don't waste your time,  please consider liking and subscribing.
