Key points from the presentation

* Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is a gas typically generated on-site and used as an aqueous solution (light yellow-green).
* ClO2 is a one-electron-transfer oxidant (free radical). It reacts by oxidation only and does not form chlorinated organics (THMs, HAAs). It reduces formation of THM/HAA precursors.
* Effective across a wide pH range; broad-spectrum biocide (bacteria, viruses, algae, biofilms). Lower required doses compared to many halogens.
* Applications in municipal drinking water: pre-oxidation (iron, manganese, organics), primary disinfection (CT credits), and supplemental control in distribution (biofilm, nitrification control). Typically generated on-site; not commonly injected directly into distribution systems in the U.S. (carried over from plant).
* Historical context: Commercial use \~80 years; significant adoption increased after discovery of THMs in the 1970s and regulatory drivers in the 1990s/2000s.
* Benefits for taste, odor, color; effective for phenols, hydrogen sulfide, and algae control.
* RO/NF pretreatment: ClO2 can control biofouling and reduce impacts of transition metals (Fe, Mn), protecting membranes and reducing sanitization frequency.
* Nitrification control: ClO2 can inactivate ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, stabilizing monochloramine systems and helping control nitrification.
* Main DBP of concern with ClO2 use: chlorite (and some chlorate). Typical conversions: \~50–70% of ClO2 dose recovered as chlorite; some chlorate formed by secondary reactions or generator/precursor issues. Ultimately these oxy-chlorine species degrade to chloride over time.
* Regulatory limits: chlorite max (MCL) leaving the plant = 1.0 mg/L; chlorine dioxide residual limit = 0.8 mg/L. Typical plant dosing around 0.5–1.5 mg/L (ppm).
* Generator chemistries: two-part and three-part chloride-based systems (require chlorine gas or hypochlorite+acid respectively), and chlorate-based systems (sodium chlorate + H2O2 activated with sulfuric acid). Other small-scale acid-chloride and electrochemical systems exist but with tradeoffs.
* Safety and design: vacuum adductors and non-pressurized chemical lines minimize leak risk. Generator options scale from small (6–30 lb/day) to large (thousands lb/day) with varying turndown ratios. Multiple smaller generators may be preferred at very large plants.
* Removal or reduction of oxy-chlorine residuals (if needed): granular activated carbon, ferrous salts (e.g., ferrous sulfate during coagulation), sulfite/dechlorination methods, and advanced treatment/bioremediation for persistent species like perchlorate (rare in practice).
* Technical services, lab training, and on-site support are important for first-time implementations.

### Q\&A (converted to expandable sections)

<details>

<summary>When used as a primary disinfectant, what is the occurrence rate of ClO2 conversion to chlorite/chlorate/chloride?</summary>

Typical observed conversions: approximately 70% of applied ClO2 may be detected as chlorite; around 5% may become chlorate; the remainder becomes chloride. These fractions depend on water matrix (iron, manganese, sulfides, organics). Chloride tends to decrease as water moves through distribution due to degradation and dilution.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How will chlorine dioxide interact with ferric chloride in a ballasted floc/packaged (BAF/ballasted) water treatment plant?</summary>

Ferric chloride (Fe(III)) is already oxidized and generally has no direct reaction with ClO2. Ferric chloride is slightly acidic; pH effects from mixing could, in theory, influence reactions, but direct conversion of ferric chloride to ClO2 at plant scale is unlikely.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What instruments are recommended to measure ClO2 generation and chlorite at point of entry (POE)?</summary>

* For generator effluent (higher concentrations): OpTech (absorbance-based) is standard but costly; Pyxis is a lower-cost alternative with good field use.
* For low-level monitoring in treated water (<1 ppm): amperometric inline monitors (e.g., Palintest/Kemio variants) or robust probes (e.g., Kunze) can be used; ion chromatography (IC) is most reliable for chlorite at low concentrations but is more resource-intensive. EPA/state-approved methods may dictate reporting approaches.

<details>

<summary>Does sodium chloride impurity from precursor chemicals significantly impact potable treatment when using two-part generators for Mn pre-oxidation?</summary>

Field experience and presenters' responses: No significant negative impact from the chloride introduced by ClO2 generation relative to background chloride in source water. The main concerns for Mn oxidation are natural organic matter and other matrix factors rather than the small chloride increase from generation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can you determine when a generator has failed?</summary>

Indicators of generator failure include:

* Loss of expected color in generator effluent/visual lines.
* Residual ClO2 measurements at the plant dropping or not detectable.
* PLC/log alarms or abnormal pH readings (if pH probes are used).
* Check generator effluent, PLC logs, residual measurements; partial failures may be gradual, total failures more obvious. Having monitoring at multiple points helps detect failures promptly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why is chlorine dioxide most commonly used as a primary disinfectant rather than as a secondary/residual disinfectant? Any benefits/drawbacks to using it as a residual?</summary>

Primary reasons:

* ClO2 reacts relatively quickly and can be consumed by pipe materials and water constituents, making maintaining a distribution residual more challenging.
* Regulatory limits on chlorite/chlorine dioxide residuals constrain high-level use in distribution. Potential benefits of distribution use:
* Effective control of opportunistic pathogens (Legionella, Mycobacteria) and control of THM/HAA precursors if residuals can be maintained without causing odor complaints. Drawbacks and operational considerations:
* Aeration of water with ClO2 can cause off-gassing; reactions with VOCs (from new furnishings etc.) can produce odors and customer complaints if concentrations are too high.
* Some systems and institutions (hospitals, certain industrial premises) do inject ClO2 locally for premise-specific control where benefits justify it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>We do not get good results from our Kemio/Palintest amperometric method. Are there better options?</summary>

* Kemio/Palintest and other amperometric devices are EPA-approved for certain reporting; issues often arise from instrument use, calibration, and operator technique.
* For chlorite compliance/low-level quantification, ion chromatography (IC) and laboratory methods are more reliable.
* Seek support from instrument manufacturers or technical reps for calibration/troubleshooting; consider IC for confirmatory analyses.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are key challenges in dosing and monitoring ClO2 in large-scale systems?</summary>

* Proper front-end planning and site survey are critical (water matrix testing to estimate demand and proper generator sizing).
* Undersizing generators or poor placement can cause inability to meet residual targets. Multiple generators and redundant installations may improve reliability and turndown.
* Reliable monitoring (inline and grab samples, instrument calibration, lab confirmation) is essential to avoid under/overdose and ensure regulatory compliance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a significant difference between using sodium chlorite manufactured from salt (sodium chloride) vs. other precursor methods for ClO2 generation? Any practical impacts?</summary>

* Differences mainly relate to precursor handling and trace impurities. Solid sodium chlorite can be hazardous in handling (friction/housekeeping risks) — many suppliers prefer liquid forms.
* Any small changes in background salinity from generation are typically insignificant compared to source water chloride. Monitor precursors and generator output for any trace co-generated oxy-chlorine species.

</details>

### Additional notes and references from presenters

* ClO2 is effective for pre-oxidation (Fe/Mn, organics), improving coagulation and removing DBP precursors.
* ClO2 does not form THMs/HAAs and often reduces their formation when used upstream.
* Chlorite is the principal regulated byproduct of ClO2 use; chlorite MCL is 1.0 mg/L leaving the plant; ClO2 residual limit is 0.8 mg/L. Typical dosing practices (0.5–1.5 mg/L) keep these within compliance when properly applied.
* Generator chemistries: two-part (chlorine gas + chlorite chemistry), three-part (hypochlorite + acid + chlorite precursors), chlorate-based methods; each has tradeoffs in safety, storage, cost, and byproduct profile.
* Operational safety: vacuum adductor systems and non-pressurized chemical lines reduce leak risk. Technical services, analytical training, and vendor support are valuable for first-time users.
