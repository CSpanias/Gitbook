If you're a Canadian senior filing your taxes this year, there are five tax credits that could put hundreds or even thousands of dollars back into your pocket. And the Canada Revenue Agency has made recent updates that many people don't even know about yet. Missing just one of these credits could cost you more than you realize. And today, I'm walking you through exactly what's changed, who qualifies, and how to make sure you're claiming every dollar you're entitled to. Tax season is here and for seniors across Canada, this year's filing comes with some important updates. The CRA has adjusted several tax credits for the 2026 tax year. And whether you're living on a fixed income, managing RRSP withdrawals, or receiving CPP and OAS, these credits can make a real difference in your financial situation. The problem is that thousands of seniors leave money on the table every single year simply because they don't know these credits exist or they assume they don't qualify. By the end of this video, you'll know exactly which five tax credits you need to claim, what the income thresholds are, how much you could receive, and the most common mistakes that cause people to miss out. This information is based on the latest Cray guidelines for 2026, and it applies to anyone filing their taxes in the coming weeks. Let's start with the first credit, and this one is often overlooked, even though it can be worth over $1,000 for some households. The age amount tax credit is a non-refundable federal credit available to Canadians who are 65 years or older by the end of the tax year. For 2026, the maximum age amount has been indexed to inflation and now sits at $8,396. This is a credit, not a deduction, which means it directly reduces the amount of tax you owe. At the lowest federal tax rate of 15%, this credit can save you up to $1,259 in federal taxes alone. Here's the key detail. This credit begins to be reduced once your net income exceeds a certain threshold. For 2026, that threshold is $43,479. If your income is above this amount, the credit is gradually clawed back at a rate of 15% of the income over that threshold. Once your net income reaches approximately $96,000, the credit is fully eliminated. Many seniors assume that because they receive CPP, OAS, or RF income, they automatically don't qualify. That's not always true. Your net income is what matters, and depending on your specific situation, including pension splitting or deductions, you may still be eligible for a partial or full credit. This is one you absolutely must check when filing. The second credit is one that applies if you're supporting a spouse or common law partner, and it's been updated for inflation this year as well. The spouse or common law partner amount is a federal non-refundable credit you can claim if you're supporting your partner and their net income is below a certain level. For 2026, the maximum amount you can claim is $15,75. Just like the age amount, this translates into a tax savings of around $2,356 at the 15% federal rate if you qualify for the full amount. The credit starts to decrease when your spouse or partner's net income exceeds zero, and it's completely phased out once their income reaches $15,75. This credit is particularly valuable if one spouse has little to no income or if income splitting strategies have been used to keep one partner's income lower. Here's something many people miss. If your spouse is over 65, you may also be able to claim the age amount on their behalf if they cannot use it themselves due to having little or no tax payable. Pension income splitting between spouses can also help maximize both the spouse amount and the age amount. So, it's worth reviewing your situation carefully or speaking with a tax professional. Now, let's move to the third credit, and this one is critical for anyone with medical expenses, prescriptions, or mobility costs. The medical expense tax credit allows you to claim eligible medical costs that exceed 3% of your net income, or $3,364 for 2026, whichever is less. For seniors, this can include prescription medications, dental work, eyeglasses, hearing aids, mobility devices, attendant care, and even certain home modifications if they're medically necessary. What makes this credit so powerful is that you can claim expenses for yourself, your spouse, and your dependent children or grandchildren. You can also choose any 12-month period ending in the tax year, which gives you flexibility in when you combine your claims. If you had a major surgery or dental procedure last year, grouping expenses strategically can push you over the threshold and increase your refund. Here's a mistake I see all the time. People throw away receipts or don't track smaller medical costs like over-the-counter prescriptions or travel to medical appointments. Those add up. If you're traveling more than 40 kilometers one way for medical treatment not available locally, you can claim mileage or public transportation costs. Keep everything. Even small claims help you reach that threshold faster. One more important point. If you're in a lower income bracket and your spouse earns more, it may be better for the higher earning spouse to claim the medical expenses as the credit is calculated against the lower earnner's income threshold. This is another area where planning makes a difference. The fourth credit is one that often gets forgotten, but if you're receiving pension income, this is money you should not leave behind. The pension income amount is a federal non-refundable credit worth up to $2,000. If you're receiving eligible pension income, you can claim this credit, which results in a tax savings of $300 at the 15% federal rate. Eligible pension income includes payments from a registered pension plan, or if withdrawals if you're 65 or older, and annuity payments from an RRSP or a deferred profit sharing plan. Here's the catch. CPN OAS do not qualify as eligible pension income for this credit. That's a common misconception. However, if you're 65 or older and you're taking RF withdrawals, those do count. If you're under 65, RF income does not qualify unless you're receiving it due to the death of a spouse. This is another area where pension income splitting can help. If you're splitting eligible pension income with your spouse, both of you may be able to claim the pension income amount, effectively doubling the credit to $600 in total federal tax savings. That's a significant benefit for couples managing retirement income together. Now, let's talk about the fifth credit. And this one can be a gamecher if you've made donations to registered charities. The charitable donation tax credit allows you to claim donations made to qualified Canadian charities. And the tax benefit is actually structured in two tiers. For the first $200 of donations, you receive a 15% federal credit. For any amount over $200, the federal credit jumps to 29%. And if you're in the highest tax bracket, it can be as high as 33%. Here's the strategy many seniors don't know about. You can carry forward unclaimed donations for up to 5 years. So if you made smaller donations over several years, you can combine them in one tax year to maximize the benefit of that higher rate on amounts over $200. You can also claim donations made by your spouse, which gives you flexibility in how you structure the claim. If you donated securities like stocks or mutual funds directly to a charity, you may also avoid paying capital gains tax on those assets, which is an additional tax benefit on top of the donation credit itself. This is especially valuable if you're managing investments in a non-registered account and looking for tax efficient ways to give. One mistake to avoid is assuming that all donations qualify. The charity must be registered with the CRA and you need an official receipt. Donations to individuals, crowdfunding campaigns, or foreign charities may not be eligible unless there's a treaty in place. Always confirm before you claim. So those are the five credits. The age amount, the spouse or common law partner amount, the medical expense tax credit, the pension income amount, and the charitable donation tax credit. Each one has specific rules, income thresholds, and documentation requirements. But together, they represent a significant opportunity to reduce your tax bill or increase your refund. Before we wrap up, let me point out the three most common mistakes that cause seniors to miss out on these credits. The first mistake is not filing a tax return at all. Some seniors believe that if their income is low or they don't owe any tax, they don't need to file. That's incorrect. Filing your return is the only way to claim refundable credits, receive JSH credits, and ensure your OAS and G's payments continue without interruption. Even if you have zero income, you should file. The second mistake is not keeping proper records. Medical receipts, donation slips, and pension statements all need to be kept and organized. The carrier can ask for proof of any claim, and if you don't have documentation, you could lose the credit. Set up a simple filing system now and keep everything in one place throughout the year. The third mistake is not exploring pension splitting or other income strategies. Many seniors file their taxes the same way every year without reviewing whether splitting pension income, timing or withdrawals differently, or adjusting their filing status could increase their credits. Tax rules change and your situation changes. It's worth reviewing your return annually or working with someone who understands senior taxation. So, what should you do right now? Gather your tax slips, including your T4A for KE and OAS, your T4 RIFE if you're taking withdrawals, any T3 slips for investment income, and all receipts for medical expenses and donations. If you're not confident filing on your own, consider using the TRA's community volunteer income tax program, which offers free tax help for modest income seniors, or hire a qualified tax preparer who understands these credits. These five credits exist because the government recognizes the financial pressures that seniors face, especially with inflation, rising health care costs, and fixed incomes. You've paid into the system your entire working life. These credits are part of what you're entitled to and claiming them is not taking advantage of anything. It's simply making sure you're receiving what you've earned.

Common mistakes & filing tips

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Not filing a return: Even if income is low, file to claim refundable credits and to preserve benefits (OAS/GIS, etc.).
* Poor recordkeeping: Keep medical receipts, donation slips, pension statements — CRA can request proof.
* Not reviewing income strategies: Pension splitting, timing RRIF/RRSP withdrawals, and choosing the correct claimant for medical expenses can change eligibility and maximize credits.
{% endhint %}

Action checklist (what to gather now)

* T-slips: T4A (CPP/OAS/pension), T4RIF (RRIF withdrawals), T3/T5 (investment income) as applicable.
* Receipts: medical, prescriptions, travel for medical treatment, donation receipts.
* Pension documents showing eligible pension income and amounts considered for splitting.
* If unsure, consider CRA’s Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) or a qualified tax preparer familiar with senior tax issues.
