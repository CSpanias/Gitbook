Welcome to a new week in the life as a fiber artist. This week I'm going to turn this design plus these into a punch needle tissue box uh cover. So, this is the tissue box I'm going to be using as a cover or as a template, sorry. And I'm going to turn it into that. The full tutorial of this whole thing is going to be a Patreon exclusive video, I've decided. But I'm just going to show you little little bits and pieces in this week and then just see where else the week goes. From here, Heat. Hey, Heat. Okay, peeps. We have a lot of projects that I've got to do this week. I think I had a fair few to do last week. What did I do last week? We finished the goose and I don't remember. Anyway, things that I want to do this week. I can finally finally finally finish the daffodil piece because I have just at the moment I've just squished the cloth into the canvas. But ultimately, I will staple this on here. I just need to go down the side of it with maybe felting. I just don't know what color to do yet. I think I'm going to have to base it off of what I've got the most of. Or I could paint the the cloth or I could embroider some felt onto it. But ultimately I can finish this this week when I have decided what to do. And then I've got a new project on the go which I'm going to film a tutorial for Patreon. Basically I'm making a tissue box cover and I'm using the theme fun house from the Pinterest predicts trends. I've drawn some horses and we're going to it's going to be like circusy. Put some diamonds. It will make more sense. I can show you guys the um uh the colored sketch so you can get more of an idea. Finally started watching Ryan Tran. I didn't realize he had he has this secret channel YouTube channel and he started it on January the 1st. And basically the concept is he's created a new world on Minecraft. For every subscriber to the channel, he has to have a chicken in game. And when I find found the channel, which was literally yesterday, so it's what I found the channel on the 8th of Feb. And he's already at 300,000 subscribers. When we watched it, obviously at the start of he had three subscribers, then it went up to 100. So it's quite fun to watch. He's got a candy brand called Joyide, and it's only available in America. If you buy a bag, take a photo, tag him, tag Joy Ride, and comment something about World 3000, which is the Minecraft world. There's a chance you'll get named as a chicken of the week. Obviously, we don't have Joy Road over here. But what I'm planning to do, I've drawn up a design and I have simplified the design. I'm going to turn it into a stuffed bag, so it's like a bag of sweets. I'm thinking of doing flat stitch for the whole thing, but for the sour strips, maybe I'll bead them or I'll do something so they look sparkly and then I will sew felt on the back and stuff it so it is literally like a stuffed bag of sweets. That's all my projects I want to get done this week. I don't have anyone booked on for the workshop on February on February on Friday. Um, which is fine. We'll see how it goes until then. But yeah, enjoy this next week in my life as a fiber artist. Dare I do the one thing I tell people not to try and do and turn over the piece before you are finished section. I'm kind of annoyed that I can't have the star on the eye like I have on the original design. There's just not going to be enough space cuz it's so small and obviously I'm using acrylic. But um yeah, I'm going to turn it over and see how the horse looks before I fill in the body of the horse. So let's have a little look. Ta. That kind of looks like um like an anteater or an armadillo or something. But yeah, stars aren't looking very starry at the moment. And I have a horrible feeling they might not look great once finished purely again because it's such a small space and where I'm using the acrylic. I don't know. We'll see once I filled in the body of the horse. But I do hope it does turn out all right. The rest of it should be fine. And these stars should be fine cuz they're a lot bigger. The diamonds should be all right, but it's just the horses where it's such a small little gap. But we will see once I filled in the body. Okay, moment of truth for the little horse. I haven't done the background, but hopefully this is going to look like a horse on the other side. Okay, it's not really horse, is it? Let's be honest. It's just I mean obviously once I go in the gap here between the two feet here and here it will have more shape and when I go in and all these little bits and like the head there'll be more shape. I might have to do the eye the black of the eye um with a needle instead. But once the rest of the stitches are in it will shape this better. And then the stars. I mean, they're looking starlike, but again, that needs some stitches in there. But yeah. Okay. So, the eye needs some work. I might have to, like I say, do something with a needle and thread instead. And I'll sort out all these loops once I've sorted out the background of it. So, I'll do the background part. And then hopefully we can make this look more horselike, or at least just better than it currently does now. desk friend. Believe it or not, I've only ever made her as a tiny little keychain. So, this was my first time making One thing I'm not really enjoying about my content at the moment is the lighting because it's just so miserable in the UK at the moment. It's it sometimes it is sunny, but even still it's not sunny for very long. And again, it's raining today and gray. And it just means that unless I'm in my room where there's a bit more natural light, I feel like the quality is not the best. And also, it doesn't put me in the mood to want to film, I also and then not in the mood to wear something nice. I'd rather just throw on a jumper and cozy up somewhere rather than trying to think about the presence on the video. But I'm going to do my best with what we have got downstairs. But yeah, the the natural light isn't the best at the moment and the whole vibe isn't really the best, but I will continue to do my best to show up and hopefully make the majority of the videos like visual aspect, okay? Um, as best that I can. And this is obviously what I mean by the poor lighting. And it just looks so dreary and like there's just it looks like the color the saturation's been taken out. But anyway, last night I started the tissue box piece and I have organized all the loops. That's why it looks all right. But I it wasn't looking too good before the loops were organized. But yeah, I should hopefully get this finished today and then I can sort out that video for Patreons and then I can draw up the next design that's going to go on here. And I think I want to do that before I do the daffodil piece. Today I'm going to finish off that piece of punch needle. I'm getting a good way through Pan's Labyrinth. It's really easy to read to be honest. And much like the last book, there's a lot of just blank pages before a chapter starts. So, now it's back to the punch needle and filming all these videos at once and trying to remember what clips. I have set up albums in my photos app. So, as soon as I filmed a segment, I put it into the album so I know which is going where. But like there'll be some clips that I've used in this one that I need to also use in the Patreon video. And just a bit like that, I need to use different clips in different places. And then also think about short form as well. So, there's a lot to think about, but let's get back to the crafting. The sun's just come out, so I just want to capture my work now. It's a bit easier to see and a lot nicer to work in. And I think the sun is slowly going and it's going to go again. Okay, so this morning I have filmed a bit more for the Patreon. I have got to this step of the tissue box. one is interested. I have one goose piece left as well. Not the other one. This one. Mr. Wright Goose is still available on the website if anyone is interested in him. And the heart pieces are up as well on the website. This morning I finished Pan's Labyrinth. And I think I think personally it was a really beautifully haunting story. It was almost like an Alice Wonderland kind of vibe but a bit darker. and I think it was a beautiful story. So, I'm looking forward to watching the movie of it. But that means I now have to pick a book. My intention is not to start a series. So, that means we can't start Red Rising, The Witcher, Atlas 6, Divers. Could read this. Don't have the first book of this. Could read The Devil of the Book Seller, which I found in my first uh free little library. I just stumbled across. Could read Treasure Island. Read all of these. just haven't read Frankenstein yet. Um, I think I've read everything here apart from Johnny Depp and I can't read this before the coffee gets cold book because I haven't got this middle two. I think this is the fourth one. Obviously, we still got Kingdom of Ash, but ah, scary. And then the other option is Stephen King, Billy Summers, or Carrie. Now, the plan will be this will be a nighttime bed read. So, these might be too heavy for that. I could read the binding cuz I'm not sure if once I've read it if I'm going to want to keep it. I could read that. It's very bookshop. Also quite booky. I don't really know what to read next. Um, yeah, nothing up there again. A bit bulky for bed. Although, I did read Dracula in bed. I don't think I want to read a classic. So, I'll take out Treasure Island and Frankenstein. So, it's between Death of a Book Seller and The Binding. I think I really do want to read Red Rising, but I don't have the other books. And much like a few of these, I don't have the other books in the series yet. So, I don't know if I want to start a series before finishing at least um Throne of Glass and Song of Ice and Fire. So, maybe I'll go for I don't know. I don't know. I guess you'll find out in this video which book I go for. Yesterday I went through and I spent time clearing out all like social media and stuff from my iPad. So, it's literally just games. And there is some work stuff in here. I do have like my website and stuff, but most of mostly this is just going to be used now for like fun things. And something I've wanted to take up in 2026, or at least I've been seeing it, so I want to do more of is cryptic crosswords. So, I downloaded the minute I think it was called was it called minute crossword or minute cryptic or something because I keep seeing it on Tik Tok and I'm just trying to teach myself how to solve cryptic crosswords. Um, obviously this isn't like a cross word in sense of all of them like a normal crossword. It's just one a day. But it's something I'm trying to understand cuz I find them so clever once you understand how to do them. So yeah, this is just what I'm going to spend my morning or not my morning. Sorry, it's not going to take me that long. I've just cooked up some sweet potatoes for something very sweet and interesting that I'll hopefully make later today once these have cooled. Okay, it is time to do some baking. First, let's mash the sweet potato. The goal is to make sweet potato brownies. I remember in secondary school things like the brownies had beetroot in them. I think it was probably the way of making sure that the food that was being given had some sort of health benefit because I believe I was in the year of primary school when the whole Jamie Oliver school dinner thing came in and changed the trajectory of school dinners and then they had to become healthy. I think the more you do things like baking and cooking, the easier it is you can that you can eyeball how much you've got of something. So, it's easier to know. But when you haven't done something before, it's not very easy to know. Everything I can't get out of this jar then fill with milk and oats and other bits and pieces and use it as an overnight oats jar. I think I'm going to eyeball the maple syrup because again, it's going to get stuck. And also, I don't want maybe a full/4 cup of it. Going to hold some back for my oats. Oh, I hope these taste good. And I believe sweet potatoes are low on glycemic index. So good for diabetics as well, which is good because I'm making them for my partner and he can enjoy them hopefully without having to worry about crazy blood sugar spikes. Right, let's try some of the brownie. It's very, very gooey, which is great. I think the peanut butter helps make it even more gooey as well. But I think that is a solid recipe, and it was so simple as well. This week's been pretty crafty in comparison to last week. I finished the tissue box. I have now finished the joy ride. And I guess that will then mean I'll move on to the daffodil piece and do the needle felting of the board and finish off that piece as well hopefully before the weekend is over. But I wanted to show you guys the joy bag that I made. All handmade. I've got punch needle flat stitch on the background. Punch needle loop stitch on the logo. I then sewed felt on underneath the text here. And then I printed out and stuck on the text. The sweets are felt with beads. And then I just used a blanket stitch to stitch some red felt onto the back. I left the top open so I could put inside wherever they've gone. Some printed out Joyide suites as well. So it kind of works like a real bag of Joyide and I'm really happy with the outcome of it. It was a really fun little creative project to do. So, I'll be posting all of that on the socials. But ultimately, we've got another little fun project that also looks really cool as well. Like, I picked this one cuz I love the pink and the yellow together. So, even just as an art piece, this is going to look really cool like on the shelf or I might even put it in the kitchen or just somewhere. Um, I can always hang some it into something if I wanted to. But yeah, that's that piece done. Obviously, tissue box as well was done this week. So, the final thing is the felting. Oh, and I also picked a book last night. I decided to go with the binding, but as I started to read it, I realized that it feels very similar to The Lost Bookshop, which I recently just read as well. And then it also kind of feels a bit similar to Pan's Labyrinth in the sense of like the mystery magical stuff. So then I was thinking maybe I should have picked a book that's completely opposite because I feel like I'm very much in this sort of world at the moment. Maybe I should have gone for something maybe like a Stephen King or something that isn't so magical realism focused around books. But I've started it so I will continue it and if I need a break I can just go back to my Song of Ice and Fire book that I'm on. But that's where we're at with all of that. The brownie was really good as well. Made the brownie. Hopefully, it's going to be even better today. So, we'll be eating that. And yeah, just a few more days of the week for you to follow along with to see what else I get up to going forward. I don't usually get through all my TBRs and I'm glad we got through like a good chunk of it this month. I'm definitely hoping to get through a good Hello Kitty. You're very cute. The texture, the sour. Shout out to Cat's Corner. Me. This is insane. So impressive. Love Ryan 3000 community.
