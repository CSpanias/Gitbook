when i'm going online and i'm researching for my vacation destination one of the first things i'm looking at a comfy amazing main bedroom so that's your challenge this week the main bedroom yes nice there's a little twist to this week's challenge you gotta work with what you have and by that i mean wood paneling that's right the paneling challenge is our challenge we are not afraid of keeping the wood paneling at all so this beautiful disgusting gross wood paneling is going to stay no drywall no choices so you have to incorporate the paneling somehow in your design what are we gonna do with this paneling yeah what you end up doing with this that's what's gonna make you stand out whoever bounces off the wall the best will win three thousand dollar cash prize all right so are you guys ready yeah well the battle begins now hi this is oh what do you think all this paneling this is uh it's pretty bad and it's not just the paneling it's the fact that the gaps between the paneling there's no symmetry i was thinking that we create a feature wall and then do something funky and cool like a geometric shape first of all i love a headboard wall yeah it's like the easiest most cost effective way to add value this game is all about value add value it's not just about putting something pretty up its form and function at its finest even though that paneling stays up it's gonna disappear right because you're only gonna look here you walk in this door and you want this boom yeah you're not even looking at this garbage yeah you're not even noticing this is gross allison was fully on board with our ideas for the main bedroom that makes us feel like we're at least headed in the right direction this week we want to keep things simple and focus on creating a fun comfy vibe we're going to create a geometric headboard wall using strips of wood and paint the whole thing green for contrast we can paint the rest of the paneling a bright white so that the headboard wall really pops we're using the same flooring throughout the house so we'll add that here and layer a cute area of rug on top to make it cozy we'll finish the room off with some beachy end tables with lamps and window treatment we really went all out in the last two challenges so we have to rein in our spending a little bit but i think we can do this all for 4 500 i love it i'm proud of you guys gotta make it work right you guys are making it work already so just keep that going we're making some uh cuts for our geometric wall in the main bedroom so as they go up all the angles are going to line up like that so we're in the workshop and we're really starting to feel the plan come together it's starting to actually come to life and all of a sudden we hear the mentors yelling for us down at the beach all right everybody come on beachside come on out so we took it off and went to go check it out \[Music] hey guys how's it it's going great good well there's gonna be a second challenge this week yes and what that means for you is an extra two thousand dollars well just like in the real world many times you have to delegate jobs to other people you just can't always do it all mistakes and communication can cost you dearly with time and it can be really expensive to fix this challenge is all about communication this week's challenge you guys have 10 minutes to come up with a design for that guest room you will then have just five minutes to communicate to your carpenter every single detail of your design because you will not be doing any of the work in the guest room your carpenter will oh god when your five minutes is up you will walk out of the guest room and close the door behind you once that door is closed you will have no more communication with your carpenter this is crazy five minutes you can't even start a conversation in five minutes you will get to furnish these rooms and anything your carpenter might have missed or forgotten you'll need to fix yourself why can't i write because we're in rush my nerves are getting to me while we're doing this planning i'm trying to like write out the plan and i'm like shaking i need another color i'm sorry i need another color okay your carpenter is waiting for each of you in your guest bedrooms okay you got five minutes to communicate every aspect of what you just came up with only one of you will be doing the communicating with a carpenter so decide quickly who that's going to be to speak for your team oh me yeah okay okay you guys got it harry i got you yeah you got it yeah all right well go communicate all right let's go visual i know you're visual guy we plan on doing wayne scouting okay five feet high for this challenge we're going to add wayne's garden as the headboard wall this will add an element of luxury and certainly add value to our guest room this is usually the type of project we handle ourselves so we're putting a lot of trust in fred to complete this design so we're going to do this on each wall time's up time's up i'm pretty sure we missed something in the communication like especially if it's in your head sometimes you don't always get it out and just defeat it yeah so we're leaving you fred come on let it rip let's go sir you got it come on only time will tell how fred does with this challenge but to be honest i'm a little worried there you go you gotta go fast you have to go fast okay today in the main bedroom we had to spray the primer it's a really important step that you don't want to skip anytime you go over just a bare wood like this especially like it's been sitting in the house that that wood yellow that stain is going to come back through so putting the primer on it's going to seal it and then we can come back over with a nice paint color that's it put your hand down put your hands down just put your hands down put your hands down put your hands down it is time to paint the headboard wall and i'm so excited i cannot wait hello hello hello beauty how's it going i'm better now okay this looks so good thank you so allison comes into the main bedroom and i feel like she's happy with the geometric wall here's the one thing about a wall like this you have to now have symmetry this is not symmetrical so you've got to make sure that your furniture anchors it okay so you really do need the same nightstands and the same lamps because remember you got mike and mina mike is someone who doesn't just play mr make it right that man is make it right otherwise i'm going to notice i don't want to like stop soon jay from designing but you know i have to teach that's it good yeah feeling good we feel good-ish good good hey guys guess what time it is speaking of man yeah i guess it's time to uh check out the communication room yes we get to see it now oh here we go let's see how good you talk and how good you listen let's go see it right let's see what you got all right let's go i cannot wait to see this see we got wow it's beautiful you guys like it this is nice so we walk into the guest room and at first glance i am just blown away it is gorgeous good job man good job but we have but then there's one small problem where's the floors there's no way we're gonna win the communication challenge room with no flooring we're missing a major element here yeah ah this is kind of red we're missing floors \[Music] you
