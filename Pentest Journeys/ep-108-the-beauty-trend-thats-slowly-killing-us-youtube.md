0:00 Picture this. I'm driving downtown here

0:03 in Bafos. It's midday. The sun's

0:06 blazing. And every beach, sidewalk,

0:09 cafe, and rooftop is dotted with people

0:12 stretched out like human rotisserie

0:14 chickens. Lobster red shoulders, shiny

0:17 foreheads, and not a hint of shade in

0:19 sight. And I can't help but think, we

0:22 know what the sun does to our skin. We

0:25 know about UV rays. We know about

0:27 premature aging, sunspots, wrinkles, oh,

0:31 and that little thing called skin

0:33 cancer. Yet, here we are willingly

0:36 turning ourselves into toast. Let's get

0:40 into it. Welcome to a brand new episode

0:42 of Beauty Unlocked the podcast.

0:46 If you're new to Beauty Unlocked, I'm

0:47 Cararissa, host of this circus. Welcome,

0:50 friends.

0:53 If you've been a longtime listener, you

0:55 know all about the shenanigans and utter

0:57 \[ \_\_ ] But is beauty unlocked?

1:03 Are you ready?

1:08 Welcome back to Beauty Unlocked. I'm

1:10 Cararissa and it's been a while and I've

1:12 missed you. Have you missed me? Today

1:16 we're taking a deeper look at the dark

1:18 side of our tanning obsession. So, why

1:20 do we do it? Why do we worship the sun

1:23 when it clearly doesn't love us back?

1:26 Let's rewind. For centuries in Europe

1:28 and North America, pale skin was the

1:31 ultimate status symbol. In the 18th

1:33 century, women in the Georgian era mixed

1:35 lead and vinegar into deadly face paint

1:38 to keep their skin ghostly white. The

1:41 historian Valerie Steel writes, "White

1:43 skin was the sign of noble birth, a

1:46 visible barrier between the aristocracy

1:48 and the peasant classes who labored

1:50 outdoors.

1:52 Back then, tan skin meant you were a

1:54 field worker. You were poor and sun

1:56 damage wasn't chic, it was shameful."

2:00 Then the shift in the 1920s, Coco

2:03 Chanel's accidental Riviera Sunburn

2:06 supposedly launched a billion tans. As

2:09 fashion historian Browen Cosgrave notes,

2:12 Coco Chanel made the suntan fashionable.

2:14 It signified that you could afford to

2:16 holiday, to be idle. It was modern,

2:19 liberated, sexy.

2:22 By the 1960s, tanning beds hit the

2:25 market. A whole indoor industry for

2:27 faking what the sun could do. In 2009,

2:31 the World Health Organization classified

2:33 tanning beds as carcinogenic to humans,

2:36 the same category as asbestos. and

2:38 tobacco. But here's the deeper

2:41 hypocrisy. While the West idolized a

2:43 bronze glow on white bodies, it

2:46 brutalized black and brown skin.

2:48 Sociologist Dr. Margaret Hunter writes,

2:51 "Skin tone hierarchies remain a powerful

2:53 force in shaping beauty standards,

2:56 social status, and economic mobility.

2:59 Even today, research by the Skin Cancer

3:01 Foundation shows that white people are

3:03 the primary consumers of tanning beds.

3:06 Yet people of color, particularly black

3:08 patients, face disparities in skin

3:10 cancer diagnosis because doctors often

3:13 dismiss or misdiagnose melanomas on

3:15 darker skin. And while white influencers

3:18 sunbathe for likes, the global skin

3:20 lightening industry worth over $8 billion

3:23 dollar pushes toxic creams on black,

3:26 Asian, and brown communities, feeding

3:28 the lie that lighter is better. Writer

3:31 and activist Michaela Angela Davis sums it

3:34 up. The features that are demonized on

3:36 black women, full lips, dark skin,

3:38 textured hair, are monetized when worn

3:41 like costumes by the privileged. A

3:44 golden tan on a white body is desirable.

3:47 Dark skin on a black body is still

3:49 policed, punished, and pathologized.

3:52 Meanwhile, here's what the sun is

3:54 actually doing to us. The Skin Cancer

3:57 Foundation says that one in five

3:59 Americans will develop skin cancer by

4:01 the age of 70. Just one blistering

4:03 sunburn in childhood doubles your risk

4:06 of melanoma later in life. According to

4:09 Dr. Elizabeth Hale, board certified

4:11 dermatologist and senior VP of the Skin

4:13 Cancer Foundation, says a tan is your

4:16 skin's way of trying to prevent further

4:19 DNA damage. There's no such thing as a

4:22 safe tan. It's all UV damage.

4:26 Yet every summer, millions flock to

4:28 beaches and rooftops, and the beauty

4:30 industry cashes in. From bronzing mousses

4:33 to sun-kissed Instagram filters, it's a

4:36 billion dollar cycle. Damage your skin,

4:39 then sell you expensive creams to undo

4:41 the damage. So, where does that leave

4:44 us? Dermatologists recommend

4:46 broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher every

4:49 single day, rain or shine, but sunscreen

4:52 alone won't dismantle the myth. Dr.

4:55 Seema Yasmin, physician and journalist,

4:57 put it best. We have to change the

5:00 narrative that tan equals healthy

5:02 because healthy skin is protected skin.

5:05 And let's not forget the glow that so

5:07 many chase is rooted in the same double

5:09 standard that shames people of color for

5:11 their natural skin. The irony burns

5:14 deeper than the sun ever could. So

5:17 what's next? Protect your skin, my

5:19 friends. It's the only one you get.

5:21 Question the beauty ideals that profit

5:23 from your pain. And remember, your

5:26 natural skin tone is not a trend. It's a

5:28 testament to your ancestry, your story,

5:30 your survival. It doesn't need burning

5:33 to be beautiful. So next time you see

5:35 someone roasting like a rotisserie

5:37 chicken, maybe remind them beauty

5:40 shouldn't hurt. And the glow they're

5:42 chasing, it might just be a sunburn in

5:44 disguise.

5:46 I hope you enjoyed this episode. If it

5:49 made you think twice about your beach

5:50 plans, share it with someone who still

5:52 thinks SPF is optional. And remember, my

5:55 loves to stay curious, stay protected,

5:58 and keep questioning the beauty myths

6:00 that burn. You'll hear again from me

6:03 next week.

6:07 Bye.

6:09 Make it clap clap.

6:14 Make it cl

6:19 Make it clap.

6:22 Heat. Heat.

6:34 Kick down.

6:38 Kick down.
