When you receive a call on a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, the phone will display the caller's name and phone number (if available) on the screen. If the caller is not in your contacts, the phone may only display the phone number.

To enable or disable the option to show caller information, follow these steps:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open the Phone app

Open the Phone app on your Galaxy S23.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open Settings

Tap the three dots icon in the top-right corner and select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Other call settings

Scroll down and tap on "Other call settings."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Show caller information

Tap on "Show caller information."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Toggle Caller ID

Tap the toggle button to switch Show Caller Information off or on.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

If the feature is turned on and you are still not seeing the caller information on your Samsung Galaxy smartphone, make sure that your phone's software is up-to-date and that the phone number is stored correctly in your contacts.
