\[Music] hello everybody happy Thursday and welcome back to another episode of govcon Hax podcast I'm your host if you're new here Ashley duel my co-host Natasha VZ and super excited to Welcome Matt stavish with uh Republic Capital Access to talk with us a little bit about how to secure capital for government contracts and kind of explain different financing options so Matt welcome thank you so much for being with us this evening thanks for having me good evening everybody now I want you guys to know drop your questions the chat you know I am not a finance here so um ask them while you have them right so I want to start off a little bit um you know just sort of with the basics there are it's no secret that government contractors whether you're new or whether you've been at this a while the financing topic does not necessarily discriminate so I just wanted to kind of have you here and provide a little bit of clarity on some of the different options that are out there and how these guys can overcome these cash flow challenges in their government contract sure well you know as a bit of background we've been doing this a republic Capital action since 2009 um I've been doing this for a decade now um since our Inception our company's funded about 1,200 contractors and 4,000 contracts so we have a lot of experience in the cash flow challenges of Government Contracting you get more cash flow issues and Government Contracting than most businesses um in my opinion primarily because of the the you can have an exponential growth you can go from zero dollars in revenue and have to deliver a $100,000 product or you can have a million dollars in annual revenue and, you know, quintuple your Revenue with one contract win so the nature of that you know comes to cash flow challenges and at its roote what we try to educate younger business owners on is cash flow challenges is a timing issue so the cash flow challenges are solved by drawing a line on a piece of paper and there's two big lines in financing the first line is did work start on a contract that's the first thing and everything before that line we call Equity and we don't do that and no one does that's you gotta figure that one out yeah so once you start working on a contract you are into a possible working capital solution and we would Define that as you need Capital 90 days or less to turn into a receivable something like that and that's probably generous for most government contractors the next big bright line in financing is when you generate a receivable to your customer that's acceptable and so the time between contract starts in that receivable generation is the hardest part so if we look at a timeline and we draw that piece of paper we have a big line in the middle for invoice and if I'm looking at it everything to my left is pre-re receivable everything to my right is postre receivable in the world of Finance everything to the right or post receivable is relatively simple to fund depending if you run into the right partners and everything pre-re receivable is tougher it's tougher because it's simply riskier you haven't done it yet so let's gauge the what's out there that's tough so we'll just go down three simple businesses we see in Government Contracting all the time services so Services pre- invoice financing we call that payroll financing that's actually pretty easy we'll do that on our balance sheet um so if you're in the service a space that's the kind under view face I need to pay people before I have a receivable um the next piece is the product folks I have to pay someone before I have a receivable to get the product to ship that has a bunch of different flavors um but we'll just call that the product space or we call that PO financing which we don't do we work with folks that have been doing it for decades and then the third is kind of the manufacturers um we see that more with mature companies and their pre-re receivable financing is called production order financing I need to buy some widget and trinkets to make a whoy much will call it um and if companies have a good handle on the pre-re receivable side then they can kind of enter the conversations in the finance base and start kind of articulating themselves in a way that um we don't have to provide that education so in order to overcome kind of those cash flow issues we always tell folks like do you need money pre-re receivable or you just need receivables financing solution and that could be at a bank that could be at a firm like ours that provides receivable funding to government contractors um there's a lot of things that that could be um how to solve that problem what I firmly believe is for a government contractor your working capital the the solution that you bring into your company capital I equate it to a buoy on the water if you have a lot of work and you have a lot of receiver then your booty goes very high and that would be a revolving solution tied to receivables um what we in from a balance sheet standpoint so if you all dust off your Finance hats and I really and Natasha firmly believe that every government contract needs to have a really good understanding of Finance because our personal guarantee the whole thing agre you got to learn it it stinks clure is awful but it's third grade math yes so so if you have current assets use a current liability financing instrument to provide your liquidity what we don't like to see folks do is get a Term Loan which is that anchor it doesn't change no matter what and that's a long-term liability against a current asset and that's a mismatch in our financial instruments now if you're going to buy a tractor you should get a term one um but for most government contractors you want to have some sort of flexible working capital solution where you only have Capital outlaid with a pretty high propensity of it coming back okay so let's let's break that down a little bit because the terminology here is important right um there most of our audience is aware of line of credit right so is that comparable to the suggestion so line of credit is so in the finance space we're really good at coming up with words and a lot of words that kind of mean the same thing so like really so are we in government right it's perfectly so um there's annual percentage rate we all know what that means yep so let's say annual percentage rate of one just for this example then there's another term called basis points so you could say 100 basis points that also equals 1% annual percentage rate or you could say 100 bips 100 bips also equals 100 basis points which also equals 1% annual percentage rate so we have a lot of words that mean the same thing um generally speaking kind of roughly a bank line of credit a factoring facility an abbl facility for a government contractor not a manufacturing one but just like a Services one primarily going to be based upon accounts receivable because that's your primary form of payback and so if you're going to get a line of credit at a bank or a receivables facility from us or someone like us it's going to be based on your AR that's going to be the the biggest as far as how much you can get in any given time and you can pull that from your QuickBooks folks and while you're in those QuickBooks click the button acrel yes please money I hope you're doing journal entries but AC cruel based on what you've earn to date not just and the bills that you've accured to date but may not have paid amen yep yes very good advice so as far as as far as types of financing options because you know we we totally understand the challenges a lot even a lot of pretty experienced companies like we were talking about you know a little bit before we went live you know these issues don't discriminate if you're new if you've been at this a while there you anything can happen right um somebody at the government can be out for two weeks and you know just maybe didn't hit the buttons the approval button um so what are some sort of real world instances where contractors have had to hurry up and find funding fast and like what should be because I know there are certain circumstances where this funding will be more accessible than this funding but let's say they don't have great personal credit that they can really depend on and their business is new but they've won contract and now they need to fulfill it but they're way behind the curve you know they're being more reactive than proactive what should they do sure so a couple things so if you have receivables out there and you don't have a way to finance those build receivables either by using a bank line or receivable financing entity then you should do that because it's the lowest risk least expensive form of financing and if you're talking about building a capital stack for your company the first step is can I finance a build receivable and if that suffices the problem then you're done and if you're still short that's step one so you need to always have that and start looking at that the second thing is you should go to a bank first like if you have personal collateral credit score like walk into a bank or use a a fellow you know government contract you know introduce to their Banker generally what I tell folks is if One Bank says they can't do the deal or provide you um a credit facility that's that's probably a you problem not a bank problem it's not because you didn't tell your story the right way it's because they're all regulated all bank's credit boxes are generally shaped the same type of square I mean there's a little bit smidge here and there but they're generally the same and so and it that's fine you know most folks starting out of the gate are not ready for a bank facility for a variety of reasons um in that instance if you're working with a really good banker and your Banker is financing your STV USB budd's company ask him for a referral the banker for a referral to someone that can provide assistance and that does two things one is in the non-bank space welcome to the Wild Wild West I've seen it all and I'll see something tomorrow that I didn't know today about something that someone did so get a referral from a trusted source and number two you're evaluating that Banker for your future needs if they can't provide you an ulterior source to provide funding for your company that would that make you be profitable or do well to come back to them and give you a traditional line that's probably not a very good banker and probably not someone you want to work with you know the the bankers are are wonderful they're the politicians of our they know everybody and it's great but they should be able to introduce you to hey this is a source to go to or you know my CPA may know a source or whatever it may be and and work that way but I would start with the bank because at the minimum you're going to need a treasury services for your company and we don't do that no non-bank lender does so you're going to need to have an operating account in a bank so you should start there and that's that's great thank you so much for that and we were kind of tossing around on banks for example Natasha you brought up a very good point in The Green Room about you know the difference between your large banking institution and your um oh my gosh Credit Union literally just slit my mind completely slit you know credit unions and again everybody is different right you could have a really great large bank and have a really good relationship with your account manager but I got lost in the Bank of America Spiel so I had to find and and this is just the where I F I was with Bank of America I want to say like six years and and nothing against them because they were great but I just needed like more of a personalized approach as I'm growing I need a little handholding um and that's just something I need and so with you know Credit Union I was able to get that handholding I'm able to they're like they're very old school like they're come in let's have conversations let's drink coffee let's talk about what your goals are and I need a little bit of that um so that I can plan for my future and they were able to give a give me a revolving loan which I only pay interest on what I use so if I need to make payroll um I can borrow from that until I receive um until I don't need it anymore now I just use it for R\&D or you know research and stuff like that but other than that you know I thought that was great so I think it really matters about your business but also about the treatment that you get from your bank because what your needs are yeah be realistic said pretty much you know if you they're not helping you yeah I I always think it's important you know there's wonderful Government Contracting bankers at a lot of banks and then you know banks are just run by humans too yeah and you know everyone has time demands and unfortunately you know it's it's kind of sometimes a math game right like obviously if we're all running a billion dollar company you know whoever's financing us is going to give us a lot of attention because that's a really important account um and if we're not as big maybe not but it's still there's there's humans involved and there's turnover um I think like for a government contractor if if you're going to really be in this business you I always the biggest evaluation criteria is do you have to explain the far to your Banker like do you know what the far is yes it's the federal acquisition regulation okay we can have conversations because I'm going to ask you for letters of financial capability when I go after soup 6 or ci4 whatever it is right I don't have to describe to the acronym you know you know soup salad of govcon so you got to balance that and there's Good Government Contracting bankers at Community Banks um at least where we are in the Mid-Atlantic um and probably there's in credit unions and folks I don't even know of near you know bases you know there's typically near bases there's you know a couple folks that what going on yeah there's a couple so but I think you want to work with someone that understands your business and the best play to start is if you're trying to get into Government Contracting you probably know someone that's in Government Contracting and ask them for a referral to their Banker yeah and that's a good place to start probably not walking in the branch that is I recommend doing that for CPA too just saying I gotta say I've been through like four of them and you guys are not all created equal so you are not all created equal on I mean and that's great because you know not only can whoever you know vouch for the banker but relationships matter actually on that note my first YouTube video ever when I first started the channel it started off with relationships over solicitations and I see your backdrop is uh very similar I appreciate that um it is the motto of our we're owned by a large family office in Arkansas called Stevens STP hns unless you're in the southeast um but their motto is relationships over transactions I and you know at the end of the day you know it's just a business deal and you know but it's about the people that are involved and you know for us a lot of the times you know we're providing funding and and it's regimented in in a predictable manner but you know the funding we're doing is to make a payroll right fun we're doing is to make sure A supplier gets paid and there's a good likel that A supplier getting paid is probably a small business so you know you you have to remember the you know the Cog at least that we're in the ecosystem is you know we're trying to make people you know sleep more and worry less um before we get into because I definitely want to ask about some some real world scenarios but before we get into that I definitely would love you to touch on if you can um things that these folks should look out for when trying to secure Capital because there's it's no secret the moment you register in Sam you just have this giant Target on your back and everyone's trying to jam their hand it is unbelievable like it's remarkable like yep um so I think when you're securing Capital again I'm I'm not very smart just keep it simple did the banker that opened your operating account no govcon asked them for a referral like step one right or find someone like yourselves like you know who do you know for this this it that cuts out so many of the folks that we probably don't want to run into on purpose right don't do a Google search is what that means guys really bad place stay away from Google if you're looking we we'll tell people like like you know if you're looking for financing on the internet like it is has gone badly definitely um but you know there's there's folks out there in a non-bank space that are Brokers that are just taking a fee for booking a deal I've run a few into a few that are very good I've run into a lot that are not um again that didn't come from a bank you know you probably didn't get that referral from a banker or your CPA or going to a convention or whatever it is um but like as far as like the pitfalls I look at more of the pitfalls as like what are the things that will put you out of business tomorrow it's when you mismatch your financial instruments you get like a long-term liability against current assets because if your Revenue goes down you still have to pay back the term and then if you grow you can't get more Capital so I think that can be risky for folks um folks that don't understand your Market um we onboarded a guy a couple years ago he's a reseller and he was was selling product to a very large buyer that's a Prime on a large government program and the finance company said we don't know them and said a very little a very very low credit limit to where he couldn't run his business but his he had a ter but he had a termination fee to was sizeable oh so you know he he he ended up getting out got him out he ended up getting the thewave because they couldn't meet his needs um and he end up doing had a great year last year that's awesome you know understand work with people that understand your space um in the non-bank space it's very common for a finance company to have what was called Dominion of funds which means the finance company gets paid first we believe at Republic there's actually a step for this in the Far Far Clause 32.8 called the assignment of claims we do it every time there's a prime contract we believe strongly in following the far some people think that out there there's probably people that don't but can we get into that a little further I want to so let's talk about that for a moment because assignment of claims is not necessarily something that a lot of people are aware of yeah um so we know the far Clause but tell me sort of what that means in the financial world the the Inception of the assignment of claims it's two-page document is started in 1940s in World War II as an enticement to get Banks to fund government contractors to develop as fund companies they were producing product for World War II obviously is a huge ramp up for the country um so it's two-page document hasn't changed since the 40s but it means that on a contract the finance company or Banks can do it too you can also do it to an escro account um it just means that that entity gets paid first so instead of the money going to the company's bank account it goes to the escro account or finance company or Banks control account could be either of those three um and then they parse out whatever dollar amounts they've owe less fees and remit the rest back to the company so means they just get paid first it's a way of kind of securing the payment stream if you will so and that document has or that form rather must be submitted with the proposal so not with the proposal it can be done the proposal nope that that'd be done um can be done at any time during the life of a contract so we have done that on the first month of a contract in the middle of a contract near the end of a contract it can be presented at any time so a contract could hypothetically have an oh moment and need to and need to reach out to someone like yourself and be like okay here's the deal and that could happen after the award it likely it does like more often than not we're brought in in the middle of a work period on a contract okay so someone's at a bank um obviously banks have various things they look for and approving credits that's probably six episodes wor but you know they don't qualify the bank wants to exit the facility and then we'll do an assignment of claims on the contracts that the company needs Finance in order to continue to meet their obligations so it's it's very common that that happens Midstream yeah it's probably atypical but it happens at the Inception okay that's actually ask a Contracting officer about this one time um and I said hey I got a like a really weird question and you probably will never hear it again but I ever because I get this question like once every four months I was like no kid what's the perception of assignment of claims from a contract Contracting officer's perspective because it has to go to the Contracting officers good question and he's like oh I love when I see assignments of claims and I'm like please tell me more with not me more and he's like well I was working with small businesses and I want them to execute on a contract and if you're doing an assignment of claims for the purposes of financing you probably have financing you probably have money to make your payroll it's one less thing I have to worry about yep he's like so I know that you're good love a gem right there um well and his his point is and I think a lot of small businesses need to understand is that your buyer you know you're a business that they're your buyer taking risk risk in is just as much as you would be taking a risk in something else yeah like are you going to be able to deliver on the solution to my customer the mission right right and so if you can't that's on them um obviously that's why there's t for C and you know t for D causes um so yeah so it's a it's a deal um so we believe at Republic strongly that you should always follow the far and live the fear of the tribunal and if the far says you should deliver a blue paper cup on Tuesday then that's a really good idea you should probably do that absolutely no I know we already have like one leg into this question as it is but to end on a good note instead of um a scary note what are some examples like some real world instances that you've experienced along the way where you know maybe there was one of those o crap moments and you know it had a happy ending essentially they all have generally good endings um I have a number of examples um so we give the best example so um and this will go from soup to nut so we had a client nice little gline about half a million dollars and we gave them letter we do letters of financial capability so what you're talking about on the pre-proposal Ashley is to suffice bar 9 9.14 which is does the contractor have the financing resources available to execute on of those particular contract I think I've done this week probably 50 Mill million dollars worth of letters w soup six is in the air we'll just say that yes oh so we're just cranking out letters left and right so we gave this contractor client a letter for $20 million there a huge gamechanging proposal they win it of course it gets protested for like nine months um we had to present a letter every protest because a lot of the protest is around could they execute well they won the contract they went from about a half a million a month in Revenue to 8 to 10 million depending on the month wow and they just sold for over nine figures in the spring of 24 wow yeah Round of Applause contract now you we got to be along for the ride and they're awesome guys there's a lot of takeaways from that story that one is they never they never ever worried about the cost of their funding all these guys cared about was margin and execution that's it they they could get our costs aren't we're a little more than a bank but we're not credit cards I mean we're low teens right make sure them we're probably a smitch cheaper but we they they all they cared about were you there to make a payroll are we executing stick it in a file drawer and let's go run the heck out of this company and that's what they did so number two is like we they were planning way around the curve so we knew about the contractor going after they're like we may need support it may have these components and we're like we would solution this this way this this way we give you this we give you that so they had all their Tools in their toolbox they knew what the problem was and then we knew that on this payroll would be the biggest issue so they were going to need a earned unbuilt facility to make a payroll before there was a receivable wow so you know that that's a good example um and that's that's very clean it's a very clean one yeah so kind of a messy example so we ran into a company it's about this time last year and they they got hooked on the um the merchant cash advance loans on Google oh yeah the broker and so the time we met them a couple hundred thousand a month so like we'll just say 300 but they had merchant cash advance loans on their balance sheet of like several like seven $800,000 wow but they were winning work and and so as they were kind of ramping up that's where we got introduced and so we um we said well there's there's a couple things here and this is kind of where we I think differentiate ourselves um we're really big Believers of we're going to kind of probably tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear so we said listen like you got 700,000 a bad debt and we don't do term loans and I could get into why we don't do them but basically like it's a conflict on our balance sheet it should be that's why like in a non-bank space you got people to do revolvers and people to term ones so we're going to bring in a Term Provider and they're going to give you 500 and you need to come up with 200 of equity and here's why there's no scenario we told them in which the math works that you can pay this back so let's just call spade a spade you can't afford to pay back any more than half a million in the next couple years so put in you're going to need to find 200k of equity and if we're not the right solution for you that's cool but I also we would be bringing a solution to you that mathematically you would not be able to perform on and that's not cool right you need to bring in two 100 okay we're going to bring in build and unbuild AR so it help you with the payroll and the receivables and start steady state get the cash flow more predictable so you can get money in um and they had a joint venture join Venture on a large contract and so this how we're going to do that so we brought in the term lender they gave him a half a million he put in the owner put in 200 of equity we brought in build and unu um and so at the you know when we met him he was building about a half a million dollars a month three to 300 to 500 month Billings and I think in December he it was a little over $2 million per month that's incredible now if if we didn't me meet him I don't know what would have happened but he was probably at any point during that process days to a couple weeks away from going out of business oh wow um because you know the rate of those MCA loans are really high and he had long-term liabilities against current assets which is a mismatch so like as he was growing like my clients if they call me and say hey Matt I I just went a new contract I'm going from 30 to 60 people I'm like so you need to double your facility they're like yeah I'm like cool we'll get you the amendment this morning have a great day you know pop the champagne so we just raise it and but if you're in a term facility like that's how that works right so that's a kind of a good case study of like you need to plan well but also be super mindful of having the right Financial instrument in your company um last story because those two Services we'll do a product company just to keep everybody happy um on the product side this's a small caveat personal pep peeve you will do as much work on a $30,000 order as you do a $300,000 order and I've never been on the BD side of a government contractor like it's just a couple things about the product space small oneoff orders are dag on hard to fund like no one really makes any money so like if you need $111,000 to deliver something to the government like that's a hel loock that's AMX that's probably not a finance company right like it's just money there so in the product space like the people that we see they're really successful they go from like zero dollars to they'll go from zero to like five million in a year and there they have one of two they have one of two components almost always they know the buyer really well you got that and then they find the thing that the buyer wants to buy and they figure that out there's other there's one other thing that they have though they may not know the buyer they know the supplier oh okay and the supplier gives them vendor terms so then they got the product and then they figure out who buys that at the government so they either know who's going to buy it and they go find the supplier figure that one out or they got the product they get favorable terms because they got the product and they go find the buyer but what we have not yet seen is someone that doesn't know a buyer and doesn't know A supplier and is successful haven't seen that one yes I've seen both the sadly there are a lot of those so we'll get a lot of calls from folks in the product space and they're like oh and you're like do you know your supplier no you know your buyer well I'm gonna bid after this B after that that's super hard to be successful aers and they won't talk to me yeah wonder why I don't even want to do anything I just want you to do it all I don't want to talk to the supplier or the buyer you got to get on the phone you gotta you got to find these people out um so supplier story um with um couple of guys they got together got a company they called me up they're like we're referred by someone to you guys and I'm like cool startup stvp and I'm like all right so what are you guys going to do you're like we're going to sell stuff to the VA we used to work there like we know what they buy I was like okay sounds good I was like so what size do you need to start this is always like the good gating question in product companies like what size of facility do you think you need because we have a minimum term just like you know like you know Natasha your business like hey rrap below this we ain't gotting out of bed this morning corre like if the rrap ain't there go down the road right yep so these guys go we'd like to start at half a million dollars I'm like all right let's go so we'll see what these guys do right so their first first year they probably did seven or 8 million and so somehow they figured out how to resell vehicles to the government that's amazing and so we hooked them up with purchase order financing through good friend of ours and this guy puts up letters of credit which is a letter of credit in the PO space is by far the most secure way to do a transaction because if you kind of think about it like I don't want to give cash to A supplier because then you know they may run off with my cash and not actually give me my product which would be bad so a letter of credit credit the cash is only given to the supplier when they've um when they've delivered the stuff or shipped the stuff that they said they're going to do which is kind of a better way to do it so they put up a letter of credit on their behalf and to a couple dealerships dealership ships to cars they invoice and they they do like six to eight of those transactions a year and they just kill it that's just kill it so I mean that's not that's not a terrible gig to have but they spent the time building the relationships they needed to work out and negotiate those terms and they knew how the government buys well not even that they so they found the dealership that would take a letter of credit yes and it this is where like if you understand so they didn't know Finance before but Finance is easy it's third grade math and they understood oh if I get a letter of credit what does that do oh that means they guaranteed they get paid Okay so they probably got on the phone to like a bunch of dealerships and he goes if I present you a letter of credit for half a million dollars it guarantees it says that when you do these things you're going to get a wire from because typically letter of credit is backed by a bank like a large International Bank right then you're going to get this wire someone there is going to understand that yeah and go this is a pretty safe transaction done and all of a sudden you're good but they knew how to articulate it and they kind of listened and they took it and they go oh this is a flathead screwdriver I can make this do this and then they got their supplier and then they would have got their buyer so they kind of put it all together but you know we've doing this for a while we have lots of you know success stories I I think that the biggest takeaway that I tell folks that are getting into the Government Contracting is it's different you're going to grow fast um it's it is kind of hard to get capital and I think what gives people anxiety is it's the one service area where you can't sign someone up you have to qualify for it right right that's a good point yeah so if I don't qualify for it how do I get it and there's a lot of ways to get it done that's why kind of we exist in that Gap where Banks can't provide capital and other folks exist but it does take some time you have to research you have to talk to people you have to get referrals um and kind of work your way kind of through it know different than you would selling your product to the government well set makes sense very very excellent advice there were a lot of gems dropped today you guys were listening um so if anyone has any questions please I don't see anything in the chat you guys are super quiet tonight um those of you who are watching us live it is your last chance if you have any questions for thatt say I hope that you guys are warmer than I am because it's freezing here in Florida we have about eight inches of snow in Pensacola and seriously they get that much in Pensa bro it's been 47 years since it's snowed in Florida nope we're all like everybody's losing their minds I heard in Charleston someone got nine inches I talked to this week we're up in Northern Virginia it's been like 15 degrees but we got two inches of snow so it's just Frozen ice now yeah I was like it looks like snow and this is Tampa what in the world I've never seen this people are vide taping like snow on the sand there were videos of people going to the beach and there instead of footprints in the sand it was definitely the snow we don't know what to do down here you in the north there's salt trucks that are like designed to spread salt on roads so I saw a video of two guys in Pensacola I think it was Pensacola they're riding on the back of a pickup like on the tailgate and they had a Solo Cup waving it around just spread the Sal we call that hash Florida man get we don't have the equipment right no I mean there were um yeah like let's go drop a quarter million bucks on a salt truck I'm pretty sure they're Contracting that out they have to we don't have that kind of equipment we don't and it was just funny cuz I sat there and I was like I don't have a coat I don't have a coat either I took them all up to Pittsburgh um but that's that actually reminded me of a lowest price technically acceptable contract driving down the road with the salt cup hanging off we need some salt that was a quick one red Solo cup yeah well well I don't see any comments from the viewers this evening they might come later on the on demand and if they do I'll be sure to reach out
