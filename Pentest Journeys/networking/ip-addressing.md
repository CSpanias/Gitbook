# IP Addressing

## APIPA

**Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)** is a fallback mechanism built into modern operating systems that automatically assigns an IPv4 address from the range `169.254.0.0/16` when a device configured for DHCP fails to obtain an address from a DHCP server. This feature ensures that the system remains capable of limited local communication rather than being left without an IP address altogether.&#x20;

APIPA ensures LAN connectivity by having **every host that fails to obtain a DHCP lease automatically assign itself an address from the same reserved block**. This range is globally standardized as a **link-local** network, meaning it is reserved specifically for this purpose and is treated consistently across all systems that implement it.
