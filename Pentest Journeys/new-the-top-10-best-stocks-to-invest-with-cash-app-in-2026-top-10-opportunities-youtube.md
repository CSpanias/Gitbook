In this video, I'm going to be showing you the top 10 best stock picks to invest with Cash App in in 2025. Huh. A few things to mention is that first, I don't actually use Cash App to invest stocks with anymore. And the reason why is because Cash App takes a huge swap percentage. If you don't know what a swap percentage is, it's basically the commission that Cash App takes for them facilitating the buying of the stock for you. Cash App takes 1.5%. So, what that means is that if you buy a stock for $100 and then sell it for $200, you're going to lose almost $5 in that process because Cash App took one buck 50 from when you bought it and then they took another $3 from when you sold it. I personally now use SoFi to invest in individual stocks and I use Acorns to do my general retirement investing. I'll explain the exact differences between the two in just a second. But first, if you guys don't know who I am, my name is Xavier. I have a master's in finance and I love finance. I love talking about money. I love helping you make money. So, if that sounds interesting to you, in this video, I'm going to be spitting some real game. I don't sell a course. I don't sell anything like that. And something to mention is that I am actually invested in some of the stocks that we're going to be talking about today. So, I do have a little bit of a financial motivation to get you to buy because if you buy, then the stock price will go up. Keep in mind guys, none of this video is financial advice. I am not a financial adviser. I'm not a registered stockbroker. I do hold holdings in some of these companies, but I am not on the board of directors for any of them or anything like that. So, let's go ahead and get started. So, something to mention before we get started is that the vast majority of my money is in my Acorns investing and later accounts. As you guys can see right here, I have a little over $50,000 inside. And if I keep investing inside of this account at the same rate that I am, it will grow to $4.4 million when I'm 62. Wow, very dangerous. The reason why I like using Acorns to invest is because Acorns will automatically invest your money into a set of highquality ETFs. If you guys don't know what an ETF is, it's called an exchange tradable fund. It's basically just a compilation of a bunch of different stocks combined together. If we check this out right here, I have a good amount of money in large company stocks, in medium company stocks, and small company stocks. So, small company stocks are like penny stocks. That's kind of just like gambling. And then medium company stocks are like companies that that could come on the come up. And then large company stocks are any Fortune 500 companies. The VEO ETF is basically the S\&P 500. But I also do have a good amount of money in international company stocks because I think the international market is very undervalued. But it's kind of stupid not to be investing in the US economy right now cuz the US economy has been going crazy over the last 10 20 years and it's going to keep going crazier. God. And what I love about Acorn's ETFs is that they only take a tenth of a percent in swaps. Compare that to something like Cash App or even my Wells Fargo investing account, you're looking at minimum half a percent. So, Acorns is not only cheaper, it has better features, but if you guys get their pro plan, which costs $12 a month, that comes with a 3% IRA match. I personally have a SEP IRA with Acorns, which I made a whole video about on this channel, which you guys can go ahead and check that out if you're interested. And I invest about $1,000 inside of this every single month. And because I get a 3% IRA match, I get $30 for completely free dumped inside of this account, meaning that the $12 that I pay literally doubles over. So, there's no reason for me not to be paying for it. But you guys probably aren't super interested in ETFs. What you're most likely most interested in is in individual stock. I am going to be giving you my exact individual stock picks and which picks I would recommend any normal investor to take. But I want to teach you guys about a concept first called asymmetric risk. Asymmetric risk is just when you divide your risk amongst a lot of different places. So it's impossible for you to get completely taken down because something to mention is that you investing in single individual stocks should be seen just like gambling. There is a lot of people who are investing into these stocks who know if the price is going to go up or if they're going to go down because of insider trading. This is why every single congressman is so rich is because they have access to information that the common investor does not. So, if they know that company B is going to have a is going to make a bunch of money because they're going to get a huge tax cut and their stock is going to be worth quite a bit, they're going to invest in it before you get the chance. And keep in mind, for every member of Congress or member of public office, they don't have to report their specific holdings till at least 90 days after they buy them. So, by the 90 days are over, most likely the pump's already done. And if you just buy it afterward, like you're kind of just wasting your money because they've already moved on and they're moving on to the next scheme. That's why I don't recommend doing that. What I recommend instead for stock investing is to look at what Warren Buffett, who is the most successful trader ever, what he did. So, ignoring the insider trading that he would do because what he would do is he would buy his way into the board of directors and then just invest inside of the stock and he knew how the stock would grow because he would just sit and wait for it. You have to take a look at what's known as the Warren Buffett investing formula. What I would recommend every single investor watching this video is do the 9010 investment strategy where 90% of your liquid assets are in a lowcost S\&P fund. Vanguard works, but I really like Acorns because you get the diversion with the ETFs and things like the IRA match. But then I take 10% of my liquid cash and also put 10% of it into bonds. And the reason why you want to put 10% of it into bonds is because it's really, really easy to sell bonds. And what's also great about Acorns is that you can sell bonds is that you can buy and sell bonds within Acorns itself. Now, I personally don't invest in bonds right now because Trump is killing the bond market. I'm going to come. Oh, what I invest instead with that 10% is individual stock. So, 90% of my investments are just strict, lowcost things that are guaranteed to inevitably go up over a long period of time. Individual stocks are going to be much more wonky. But in my opinion, the most important metric to look at for a stock is the price toearnings ratio. And what the price to earnings ratio is the share price divided by the earnings per share. This is basically how to figure out how much of a stock is just hype compared to how much is actually worth it. And keep in mind the average price to earning ratio is around 20 to 25. A low price to earnings ratio is below 20. And a high price to earning ratio is above 25. So, if we look at a stock right here like Disney, the price to earning ratio is 34, which is crap. That means that the Disney company is hugely inflated right now. But let's take a look at something like Home Depot. Home Depot right now has a 25, which is an average, meaning that it could be an okay buy, but not a great buy. How about GE Airspace? 30. Nah, that's probably really high right now because a lot of people are interested in defense contracts because Trump is talking about increasing defense. What about Nike? Nike has a 24. Maybe a potential option. But something that I've leveraged a little bit of my money in is Bergkshire Hathway. So, first off, just looking around where I live, Berkshire Hathway has been buying up a lot of real estate recently and they are selling it for a massive profit. You can go on Zillow right now and any of the real estate that's being sold, a lot of it is Bergkshire Hathway property. Now, there is a conversation to be had that private hedge funds probably shouldn't be allowed to, you know, leverage the US housing market as a basically a stock broker and that's how 2008 happened. But if we check out Bergkshire Hathway's P\&E, it's currently at 12, which is killer. So Bergkshire Hathway is something I personally have a little bit of my 10% invested in, and I think they're overall a really good call. And what's great is that they're down right now because Trump's tariffs, which he's actually rolling back those tariffs right now. So it was all just a waste of time over nothing. Now, I know I'm going to get a lot of comments about this, and the last video that I made this made a lot of people upset. I don't recommend buying Nvidia. And I think this is my most controversial statement without a doubt cuz I know a lot of people have made money with Nvidia. Like check this out. In the last two years, the stock has gone up almost 100%. Nvidia has made millionaires literally four times. It's gone up four times, which is crazy. The AI bubble is over. Everybody knows now that the that AI isn't very useful. I'm sure you're willing to admit that. Everybody knows now that AI isn't super useful. AI companies don't need many more chips now. So because of that, Nvidia's earning is going to start dropping hard. Plus, their P\&E is \[ \_\_ ] 38 38 P\&E. That is like an insanely overvalued stock. For reference, Apple also has a huge P& right now. Apple has a 37 P&. And the reason why the stock is pumped up so much right now is because people just expect Apple to keep doing well. Even though Apple hasn't really made any real innovations in the last 10, 20 years. The most innovative thing that they made is the Apple Watch, which like already existed before they made that and it's like not even that useful anyway and not a lot of people have them. Apple is a company that is built on brand loyalty and the second that that brand loyalty starts to go away, it's over. Now, here's a stock I'm going to get some flak for. China Automative Systems. China Automative Systems right now has a P& of 4.2. They have sold over 5 million units and they're expected to overtake Tesla. This is definitely a speculative stock for me. I only have like a hundred bucks in here cuz this is kind of like I don't know, you know, there there's not a lot of price action going on here. The spread isn't that high, but and the spread is huge. Just look at this right here. And it's probably going to tank a couple more times before I bought it at 4.4 right here about a month ago and it literally hasn't changed. And if you're going to buy a stock like this, I recommend that you go in with the mindset that you're going to be holding it for at least 6 months. And if you can't hold it for six months without getting cold feet, then don't invest in visual stocks and just put all your money in the S\&P or an Acorn, which by the way, if you're interested in the broker that I personally use to invest in stocks right now, it's actually SoFi. SoFi has a really, really low swap rate. And if you guys sign up to SoFi using my link in the description, you will get a free $300 just for doing so. Also, if you guys sign up to Acorns using my link in the description, then you will get another free $5 just for signing up. Wait a minute. Who are you? So, secure your financial future and sign up for them. It's literally completely free. SoFi is 100% free. Acorns you do have to pay for, but they do have a free version. But I'd recommend paying for them. I think it's really good. But another thing to mention about Nvidia is that their stock has not really gone up at all in the last year. A year ago, it's at 87 and today it's at 112. So, it's $30 more and within the last 6 months, it's basically maintained the same. And I got a ton of \[ \_\_ ] for talking down Nvidia. And then in one day when this random Chinese company came out with like some AI model, it crashed 25% and then it came back up and now it's back down again. Nvidia is like the most pumped stock pump stock right now. It is a terrible buy. I would not recommend it. I know that a lot of people are going to watch this video and they're going to leave mean comments because Nvidia just went up another five points or Nvidia just got to 150 or whatever. Nvidia is going to crash. It is a company that is built on hype. It's not a company that's built on real good innovation. Brand new 5000 series is literally only good because of software, not because of hardware. Their hardware is starting to die. And I know that a lot of people who are going to leave mean comments are in the process of getting scammed by Nvidia. And even if they haven't bought any Nvidia stock, they're still going to try to dunk on me even though I'm right here. Because people who are falling for a scam will never admit that they are. People would rather get scammed than admit that they even have the potential to be scammed. And am I calling the video a scam? No, I'm just calling it a bad buy. I don't think you have the facilities for that, big man. I do also have some long option puts on Nvidia, so I am motivated in a way, but I genuinely don't believe in Nvidia. Also, a terrible investment right now is Boeing, but you know why. And another stock that I know I'm going to get some crap for that I do have a little bit of money in, like 200 bucks, is United Health. So, United Health has had a pretty downturn before their CEO deservedly got shot. As you guys can see, it's down like well over $100. But the thing is that their earning is still at an all-time high and it's only going to get better because we're never going to introduce any real regulatories to fix them. So, you might as well just make money off of it. Their P& is a little bit high. That's why I don't have a lot. It's $30, which is quite a bit. But, I think for a long-term hold for at least another 6 months to about a year as long as Trump doesn't say that he's going to fix anything regarding healthcare, which he never is because no politician ever is because they're too crap for it, then you might as well just take advantage of it. Because I bought it at around about 460. I bought it about a week ago and you guys can see I'm already up about 20 points. It's just something to mention. I know it's a I I know it's a terrible thing to buy, but if it makes money then at the end of the day it makes money. Another good one to invest in right now is Meta. Meta's at a P& of 26 and even though they're a bit on a downturn, I don't know, there's potential here. I do have a little bit of money in this one, but they need to pull something out of their ass for the stock to start going up again. But what I will say is that their P& is quite solid. They're making a good amount of money and they're making arguably more money than they've ever made before. Amazon, I would say, right now, is not a great one to buy. As you guys can see, it's at 35 PNA and the stock has dropped, what's that? 40 points in the last couple months. Jesus, 40 points since February. That's bad. But you want to know one that I think is actually really, really good right now that nobody's talking about? Walmart. Walmart's on a downturn right now. But Walmart's earnings is starting to go up real quick because their online shopping is really starting to lock in and Walmart Plus is starting to do really, really well. Not as well as Amazon Prime, but I think there's a lot of potential right here with Walmart that people aren't seeing. Their P& is quite high, so this is definitely a speculative one. I only have like a couple bucks in here, but definitely one to think about. But I would say those are my main big stock picks of 2025. Right now, I'm planning on holding Bergkshire Hathway, a little bit of Meta, a little bit of Walmart, and a little bit of Chinese Automotive Incorporated for the most of the year, and I'm going to see how they end up, and I'm going to update you guys on this channel with how my investments are going. Thanks. Love you. If you guys want to get started in investing today, I truly do recommend the SoFi and the Acorns route. 90% of your money should be put into things that can be held long-term and will make you a lot of money long into the future. 10% can be put into a little bit more speculative investing where you're okay if it jumps up and down quite a bit. I really really recommend Acorns for that long-term investing. Always find ways to diversify risk. We do not gamble on this channel. I don't support buying meme coins or anything like that. We look at the numbers and we try to actually make a good investment. I also don't sell a course. I literally just gave you guys everything that I know in this video for completely free. So, the only thing I can say is thank you guys so much for watching. I genuinely do love making these videos and I want to make more videos just like this one. This topic does a lot for me. I I really really enjoy talking about it. I also really love proving people wrong about Nvidia. I think it's fun every time. And the only thing I have left to say is thank you for watching and I hope that you have a good day. Bye.
