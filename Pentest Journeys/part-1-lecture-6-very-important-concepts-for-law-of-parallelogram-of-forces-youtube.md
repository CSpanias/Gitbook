welcome to all it is part one lecture six this you can see in the title only and thumbnail also remember we already applied law of parallam forces for some simple cases now time has come to understand or know very important concepts for application of law of parall forces one by one I will tell you should make a note and see some of the statements in the class I will dictate as I told earlier you have to write it so in the class I will dictate only in the notes I will write all those things see first one by one this remove not required this everybody will knowing this one okay

first one remember there are two forces here see whether forces are this way or this way or this way or this way or even this way and this way more angle this all does not matter we want two forces passing through a point angle is Theta see I write here P1 and P2 are two concurrent forces concurrent forces passing through a point passing through a point I will do one thing to save the time say w say w making an angle making an angle Theta between them okay so here see you can call you can make a note you can call any one P1 any other P2 there is no restrict if you want you can call this as P2 this as P1 this as P1 this as P2 this as P1 this as P2 anything see Theta Theta Theta Theta Theta or one more see Theta one of them P1 one of them P2

now you have to observe something make a note see if Theta is less than 90° Theta 90° a special case I won't discuss less than 90° then see I simple language I write 1/4 this way but one important both the forces should be either acting away from the point or acting towards the point yesterday I told what to do or simple language both should be either outgoing or incoming this I'm telling 100 time I think now see now this angle is less than 90 see this angle Theta is less than 90° then which is P1 which is P2 is not required that is not important for us now how resultant will come see here when you consider parallelogram of forces see one side here this Force here complete the parallelogram this a point this is the resultant see therefore resultant will come this way I Mark here only resultant not horizontal in between resultant R if it is less than 90° it will come in between it will be closer to this force or closer to this Force depending upon the magnitud of the force if the two Force are equal then resultant will bisect the angle

suppose Theta is 80° if both the force are equal resultant will make 40 40 40° each suppose suppose imagine for an understanding make a note this way say 80° 1/4 P1 I will call 1/4 P2 if P1 equal to P2 resultant will make 40° here 40° here suppose P1 is more than P2 then resultant will be more near to P1 why which is the higher Force resultant will shift that side then see this angle this angle here will be what so I write here see if P1 is more than P2 then P1 P2 I'll do one thing P1 more I told so bigger I will write P1 resultant will be this way surely this angle will be less than 40° this angle will be more than 40° now how much lesser you can't tell if P1 is very very high compared to P2 it can come even 10° also 5° also or even 1° also possible or suppose P2 is more than P1 you should write everything that is what see this is actually I told oh I P1 correct I told P1 here P2 here suppose P2 is more than P1 you don't bother which is P1 P2 see P1 P2 bigger angle is same 80° only take 80° then same if Theta is 80° resultant will be near to P2 then this will be less than 40 because near to this one this angle will be more than 40° or right resultant will shift that side or it will go near to that Force which has got higher magnitude it is quite common sense this is if Theta is what less than 90° okay

now come to other cases this all you have write see in the class I will explain if you want very systematically you have to see the notes only for that one see now consider important case consider the case consider the case ah I forgot one thing I forgot one thing when Theta is less than 90° when you find alpha 1 or Alpha 2 you will get both positive so therefore no confusion no confusion both will get positive means how you marked result will be in the same direction so this I explain once again it can never come negative because I will tell the reason it later

now consider the case case of theta more than 90° but less than 180° see if Theta is 90° it is a simple case if Theta is 180° you do not require law of parram of forces why difference of the two forces will give the answer this all I told earlier then that is see here that is I take 1/4 here P1 don't bother horizontal vertical P1 other Force P2 P2 see correct P2 passing to point I'll take one more case Point say once again P1 this is P2 this is your Theta this is your Theta now very important you should not take this Theta why because see when the two forces are going this way result see one minute now I show the resultant here see I show the resultant P1 here P2 here o here also I do not know which force is more which force is lesser that I will explain later P2 P1 see see when you construct the parallelogram forces what will happen see here when this Force this force will come this way this will come this way complete the parallelogram this is the resultant here also same way resultant for both this is for both the sketches therefore resultant see it may be near to P1 near to P2 but anything randomly I'm putting resultant are resultant R here also depends what if P1 is more than P2 resultant will be near to P1 if P2 is more than P1 resultant will be near to P2 that is it will shift this side

now very important see this is angle alpha 1 this is angle Alpha 2 here direction see correctly don't byal clockwise anticlockwise from the force P1 Alpha 1 do not be clockwise anticlockwise Alpha 2 now what happens is here this is the angle Theta Theta is less than 180 I will tell it later if Theta is more than 180 never apply law of parallam forces for that one as it is because it will give wrong concept see I will tell you little later suppose one force here other force is here some will tell sir this Theta is more than 180° no cancel it take this Theta so that resultant will go this way see to draw parallelogram you can't draw this side you have draw this side now so remember therefore one important never and never never and \[Music] never consider Theta more than 180 by chance in a sketch

see for example in a sketch a question given 60 Newton they will tell here 80 Newton they will deliberate this this angle is 200° find the resultant if you take Theta this way you may Mark resultant this way wrong see resultant will be this way now if you want draw parall forces how to draw see here it should come here okay see for this okay I'll explain here even if they give this 200° here when you draw parram forces see here 0 80 to some scale I'm just telling 80 randomly 80 Newton now how you can draw parallelogram here now see this resultant so what you have do is this is the angle Theta you have take so that Theta will be equal to if this is 200° undoubtedly it is 180 160° this I should not explain for somebody who is studying engineering if if this is 200° why this is 160° if I explain someone will tell you better not teach why this is beyond the level some dignity required see some minimum requirements are there for those who are learning so so 160° so therefore make a big big note now a big big note I will tell you now when you apply law of par forces see if is less than 90 no problem if it's more than 90 okay see you can turn whatever way you want no problem see this way resultant will pass this way if it is outgoing Force if incoming Force resultant will come this way that is no problem now if the Theta is by chance I turn the hand now I think my hand I difficulty because what to do I can't turn if the Theta is more than 180° given here don't take that Theta take this Theta or make a big note your Theta for calculation purpose should be any value from 0 to 180° in case Theta is they give other side angle if the angle given between the two forces from other side more than 180° do not consider resultant on that side consider resultant on that side where Theta is less than 180° see otherwise what will happen you may Mark resultant this way no see this way this way resultant this way so make a firm note how the force are outgoing same way resultant or how the force is incoming same resultant make a big note

furthermore in the class I can't tell see I told you for your information just outside the subject now another one week time I'm starting sending the notes for those who register it I will make a separate class I'm telling because people will understand the importance of the notes because each and everything what I tell here will be there in Words with examples and sketches okay now leave it so remember now now before I go to next part now one firm we will never consider Theta more than 180° make a firm note okay make a firm note okay

now discuss the cases now I tell you what happen see see correctly what concept now see very important concept it is not for time pass I told subject I'm teaching complete mechanics strength of materials and analysis in the same way I will teach and remember those brain teasers also I give answer there are more than hundreds I will give answer one by one because I told knowledge let it spread see now I will start fresh now start fresh but one warning warning now I should not tell warning 100% sure that the is never more than 180° this is guaranteed now don't ask me once again you can't ask so if it is more than 180 take other side angle okay okay how many times I have to tell it see there's a limit for patients people should understand this one this is not high rocket science to understand that R be the magnitude of resultant Force resultant Force remember make a note resultant for before that one let let alpha 1 be angle made by resultant I'll put R only resultant R to save time resultant r with the force P1 with the force P1 or or Alpha to B angle made by resultant r with the force P2 with the force P2 as shown as now later I as okay now see remember now two cases are there before going to as sh right here note Theta can be how is your Theta your Theta can be less than 90° or your Theta can be more than 90° but a little bigger I put here see I put here two important cases see note Theta can be you that Theta can be less than 90° right this way you write here or it is possible that your Theta is more than 90° but less than 180° means see any1 P1 other P2 any1 P1 other P2 now I write here now irrespective of this is my special word when I want stress something actually i r r that's all see you right irrespective of but I will write sometime in the class irrespective of someone will tell which English not English sometimes tell that way irrespective is to stress the point just for fun

irrespective of whether Theta is less than 90° or Theta is more than 90° and R less than 180° remember more than 180 it will never come if it is exact 180 there is no theorem required if it is exact 90 direct case when incline is between the mle degrees remember I write here Ral = to square root of P1 squ plus bracket not requ P2 s + 2 P1 P2 bracket is not there into cos okay no bracket why P1 s + P2 s + 2 P1 P2 into cos Theta and Alpha 1 you write here I should not tell angle made by resultant r with the force P1 equal to tan inverse of I told so many so many times other Force P2 into sin Theta divid by that force with which you are referring P1 + P2 2 into cos Theta or Alpha 2 that is angle made by resultant made by R why waste space made by resultant r with the force P2 with the force P2 equal to tan inverse of we are referring with the force P2 numerator other Force P1 into sin Theta / by P2 + P1 into cos Theta this a result this is valid for whether Theta is less than 90 or more than 90 more than 90 up to 180 above 180 problem decide anyway

now one want in the class you never bother more than 180 because if it is more than 180 trap parallelogram will come on other side see the P CAP dropped because protesting how many times you are telling it see maybe it is telling me don't tell again and again okay now this much over see everything over okay now be very very careful now be alert red color B alert Alpha when you see when you find when you find alpha alpha means what either alpha 1 or Alpha 2 anyone better write the answer write answer with the sign here only with sign when you go later for resolution I will tell you no sign I will be careful I will tell the reason here with sign now positive sign indicates you write here first of all make a note you make one more note here positive or negative sign has nothing to do with the clock clockwise anticlockwise don't by heart clockwise positive anticlockwise negative no what is the principle positive sign indicates that direction considered Direction considered in sketch one sketch you are writing in sketch is correct correct therefore what to do therefore what mark angle Mark angle Alpha in same direction in same direction remember same direction or right here if you consider clockwise answer comes plus yes correct it is clockwise or if you get if you consider anticlockwise answer comes plus means what yes correct it is anticlockwise so don't byy clockwise positive see here one sketch is gone now okay sketch where is the sketch now I removed the sketch or I not shown the sketch I think actually sketch is known for you okay I a sketch later okay this is positive sign means no problem

now one note one not if Theta is less than 90° there is no chance of getting negative sign for answer for Alpha for alpha alpha Alp 2 why reason tell me because write the reason here because any s of any angle s of theta if less than 90° is always positive C of theta if less than 90° is also positive positive positive positive positive positive positive therefore there is absolutely no chance of getting negative sign therefore you will because why because sin Theta and cos Theta both are positive positive for Theta less than 90° therefore when you finally write the answer you should write I'm rting what direction you consider alpha 1 or what direction you consider Alpha 2 mark it in the same way don't be clockwise anticlockwise so Theta less than 90 is fully cleared now

consider the case when Theta is more than 90 see here what happens more than 90 but guarantee less than how much 180° that is guaranteed okay now I do one thing now this I remove now okay this is very very important remember especially objective questions now now consider case now consider the case when your Theta is Theta is more than 90° but of course less than 180 someone will ask sir why less I will tell my cost is not suitable for you how many times I have to tell you more than 180 you don't consider okay sir sorry then remember then see right here any for any angle for any angle more than 90° but less than 180° sin Theta s of the angle Theta is guaranteed positive you should know it sin Theta 0 to 90 both s and cos are positive above 90 up 180 s is still positive y means trigonometry but but cos Theta will be negative you don't have to write it when you use the calculator it will take negative you remember it negative therefore see cos Theta can be negative see here here see now P2 sin Theta sin Theta therefore in the expression in the expression for both alpha 1 and Alpha 2 Alpha 2 numerator numerator will be 100% positive why sin Theta is there sin Theta is there but what about denominator right but right here what about denominator denominator in denominator in denominator see one force term is there one force into C is there one term is one term is purely Force purely Force other term is other term is force into cos Theta and summation is there summation Is there further more simplified is it not high school high school students one term is here P1 is a force other is force into cos force force into cos now now sign for denominator sign for denominator denominator depends on depends on whether that Force term is more or what whe fourth term is more a fourth term is more numerically four term is four term is numerically more or other \[Music] term that is force into cos Theta is numerically more numerical no sign numerically more or other term

now I'll conclude this one first of all this much explanation is not required simple language show the here see this one now see I write here now see correctly if numerical value if numerical value of four term alone is more then denominator denominator will also be positive will also be positive I'll give example see numerator guaranteed positive denominator two terms are there see now if this new numerical value 20 this is minus something 18 I told numerically see numerically when Theta is more than 90 the second term is guaranteed negative why cost is negative no positive negative positive is higher numerically higher so this also is positive positive therefore we will get we will get positive sign for alpha alpha means Alpha 1 or Alpha 2 therefore very happy very happy why very happy because no confusion confusion comes when negative sign comes no confusion hope it is Crystal Clear see in the notes I will split with three four examples there see this is numerator is always positive denominator two terms are there see now if this new numerical value 20 this total minus 80 then 20 is more this is also positive High School level mathematics so therefore no confusion okay

now concluding part I write here everything you have write one after other one but sorry Canada language but me Canada we call but if fourth term if numerical value if numerical value of four term alone is lesser and numerical value of force other term Force into cos Theta is more that is example see Alpha tan inverse of numerator 100% positive denominator this is 30 minus of see 30 plus here see plus - 45 oh therefore this will be negative more then denominator nator will be negative will be negative therefore tan Alpha see either alpha 1 or Alpha 2 tan Alpha when we substitute when we substitute will be will be negative will be negative then what to what it means what it means and what to do I'm there to sacrifice to know everything here then what it means and what to do that I will write some full Bo here one minute I remove everything I'm now explaining the case see when that is you get when you are about to press tan inverse display is negative now I will explain with the full board wait 1 minute because I have neatly the board very powerful concept okay now start I'm going to to write in different color the important concept not black and red red is for resultant see I use green color to highlight it what it means and also what to do if we get negative sign for Alpha either alpha 1 or Alpha 2 before you go further first remember before you proceed further first remember when we use calculator use calculator and when you take inverse when you consider tan inverse tan inverse we will never get angle angle more than 90° actually 90 also will not come because tan 90 is infinity okay leave it you will never get more than 90° first remember in any calculator any I think throughout the world it always gives angle less than 90° it will never give more than 90° there's a reason for that one leave it mathematics 90° and in calculator calculator sometimes sometimes when you press when we consider when we consider tan inverse or when you perform tan inverse of something that Alpha that Alpha that Alpha is red color because why it is a result that Alpha again I'm telling Alpha means alpha 1 or Alpha 2 don't bother about it Alpha that Alpha when we then that Alpha will come in display in display either with positive sign or negative sign actually positive sign it won't tell plus understood un sign is positive sometime negative will come see now if positive happy already over happy why no confusion no confusion but if negative H see what it means and what to do if you get negative sign for Alpha so option one I will tell you I will give option one option one option one will be Mark that angle alpha mark that angle Alpha again I told alpha 1 or Alpha 2 Alpha in a direction in a direction opposite opposite to Direction con Ed in sketch considered in sketch in sketch that means it can be either alpha 1 or Alpha 2 in case you mark clockwise negative comes Mark anticlockwise or in case you consider anticlockwise negative comes Mark clockwise or what direction you consider Mark in a direction opposite to the direction considered in the sketch one option

how how someone will ask sir how wait examples coming up examples thoroughly thoroughly coming up coming up wait for some time don't be in a hurry remember this one when I solve examples I will tell you that class I will tell if you are not gone through the previous class class six do not come to this class I will tell I will tell at that time I will announce there you are not fit to learn from me you are not serious my education is not meant for you if you are that much lazy and you think you know everything and skip that class now you get confusion it is your problem not my problem correctly go through that class then come I will tell how don't worry

now I will tell option two see I will tell option two see option one is okay now this is okay option two I think this is best option no confusion best option both are okay I prefer this is a best one best option I will explain both best option first of all note note tan 180 + Alpha see any angle Alpha Theta or gamma beta anything tan 180 + Alpha is also equal to tan Alpha you should know that one first remember tan 180 + Alpha is tan alpha y means mathematics first quadrant all are positive second quadrant sin positive third quadrant tan positive fourth Quant cos positive okay that all I'm not bothered you should know this you requireing the chapter principal stresses in strength of materials I will explain at that time tan 180+ Alpha is tan Alpha therefore if you get you get \[Music] Alpha with the negative sign negative sign what to do is then what then see I use this color add add 180° to 180° to to that Alpha value displayed in calculator displayed in calculator calculator and write that Alpha equal to minus whatever you got comma or you can tell one more thing either write that value this is whatever you got question mark whatever you got or R plus another value another value that is what that minus whatever you got + 180 I will tell you suppose you get Alpha One value minus 10° in the calculator calculator then write Alpha = to -10° or - 10 + 180 becomes + 170° actually 10 will not come Plus 170° plus it is plus actually plus 170 and and use that second value second value with the positive sign with the positive sign for marking angle for marking Alpha in sketch one minute now let me see the display there in the camera okay visible or I will tell one more example here actually not required see it's already over that is use this value or lastly see suppose note Alpha comes Alpha comes in calculator some higher value minus minus 80° decimal will come then write then write Alpha = - 80 or - 80 see - 80 + 180 is + 100 or+ 100° and use this use this how wait for some time examples are coming up exclusive example I will take four problems there I think three problems sufficient one first problem angle more than 180 sorry angle more than 90 less than 180 Alpha 1 Alpha 2 both will come positive some will tell sir good okay over second round once I will I will see that alpha 1 comes negative then one more question and Alpha 2 comes negative I will consider both of them and then I will tell in future you have to remember so class number five this is class number six I think six and coming up seven are critical now I decided not to go for very lengthy classes usually class of around up to 1 hour only I will take except when requirement is there sometimes I may be forced to take a class of higher duration like even sometime a class can go up to 3 hours also if emergency is there if a lengthy example is there otherwise I decided upload more classes small duration because nobody want to go through class of 1 and a half hour 2 hour like that okay almost I decided almost daily upload the classes spare that much time to improve your knowledge

now lastly I will tell one more thing for those who really go through entire class I doubt very much so many have no patience these are all simple way I'm explaining for understanding for students all those who are learning one who is learning he has got limitations you should not trust too much on him see that he learns in a simple way therefore I always take simple way because some may comment inste of this way you can tell technically some other way I will tell come I will tell technically let me see whether you understand or not technically I can talk this is all simple procedure that's always what I am explain in a simple way to make everything clear then those who want will improve their knowledge let them come up in the Life in struct engineering then we'll talk technically if someone comes to me later tell sir I'm technically very sound everything understood shall we talk technically yes will talk technically okay if at all someone someone will do that way therefore don't bother about such comments if it comes simple way to simple is telling yes two simple only is important

okay now I wind up this class I first thought today I'll will cover problems then I decided no better first give complete idea about that one so that when I go to numericals examples further see earlier case I took less than 90 when I go to more than 90 now within 180 I will explain at that time but I will tell this class is important if you if you not gone through previous class I will tell better not continue this class that much responsibility for you okay thank you see you in the next class with more examples
