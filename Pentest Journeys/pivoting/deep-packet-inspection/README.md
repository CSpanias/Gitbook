# Deep Packet Inspection

**Deep packet inspection (DPI)** monitors traffic based on rules, often at the network perimeter, to detect suspicious patterns. It can block specific protocols (e.g., SSH), breaking port forwarding or tunneling. To bypass DPI and similar controls, itâ€™s important to learn multiple tunneling techniques, such as HTTP and DNS tunneling.
