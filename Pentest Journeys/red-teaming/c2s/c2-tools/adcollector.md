# ADCollector

[ADCollector](https://github.com/dev-2null/ADCollector?tab=readme-ov-file) is a lightweight .NET tool designed for rapid, low-noise Active Directory enumeration during the early stages of post-compromise reconnaissance. It focuses on extracting high-value information—such as key attributes, ACLs, and trust relationships—without the overhead of full-domain scraping, making it suitable for large enterprise environments where stealth and speed are critical. While not a replacement for comprehensive tools like PowerView, ADCollector provides a fast, automated overview of the AD landscape, ideal for triaging potential attack paths before moving to deeper, targeted enumeration.

{% tab title="ACLs" %}
Enumerating ACLs via LDAP is difficult due to the binary format of the `nTSecurityDescriptor` attribute, which requires specialized parsing. Tools like ADSearch and StandIn lack full support for decoding this data. ADCollector handles ACL enumeration more effectively with structured output, though BloodHound remains the easiest and most complete option.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Enumerate the DCAL of DAs
ADCollector.exe '--DACL "cn=domain admins,cn=users,dc=dollarcorp,dc=moneycorp,dc=local"'
```
{% endcode %}

To check if a user has `Modify` or similar rights over directory objects, the `--ACLScan` flag can be used along with the target username. It scans DACLs tied to both the user and any groups they belong to, providing a complete view of direct and inherited permissions.

```bash
ADCollector.exe '--ACLScan student337'
```
