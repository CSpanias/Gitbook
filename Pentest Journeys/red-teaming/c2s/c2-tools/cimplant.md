# CIMplant

[CIMplant](https://github.com/RedSiege/CIMplant) is a C# reimplementation and extension of [WMImplant](https://x7331.gitbook.io/notes/), designed to interact with remote systems via WMI or CIM.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
CIM (Common Information Model) is a platform-independent standard for representing systems and services. Microsoft's implementation, MI (Management Infrastructure), is a modern alternative to legacy WMI. While CIM defines the schema, WMI and MI serve as interfaces to query it. Tools like CIMplant use CIM/MI over WinRM to gather information and manage remote systems.
{% endhint %}

It supports both credential-based and current-session authentication, and provides functionality for command execution, data collection, and exfiltration. Local administrator rights on the target are required. Some operations leverage PowerShell internally, indicated with `**` in `--show-commands`.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
# Using the basic_info module
CIMplant.exe "-s dcorp-adminsrv -u <user> -p <pass> -d dollarcorp.moneycorp.local -c basic_info"

# Enumerate the language mode
CIMplant.exe '-s dcorp-adminsrv -u <user> -p <pass> -d dollarcorp.moneycorp.local -c command_exec --execute "$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode"'
```
{% endcode %}
