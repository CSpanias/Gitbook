# PEzor

[PEzor](https://github.com/phra/PEzor) is an open-source shellcode and PE packer designed to convert Windows executables into obfuscated, in-memory shellcode payloads. It wraps tools like Mimikatz and donut, enabling features such as userland hook removal, anti-debugging, raw syscalls, XOR encoding, and flexible memory protection options (e.g., RX sections or fluctuating access). Outputs can be tailored for reflective DLLs, stand-alone executables, beacon BOFs, and .NET loaders, and it's fully compatible with Sliverâ€™s `execute-assembly`, making it ideal for stealthy execution in red team operations.
