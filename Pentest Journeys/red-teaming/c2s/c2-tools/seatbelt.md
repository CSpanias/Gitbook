# Seatbelt

[Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) is a C# post-exploitation tool that conducts comprehensive system surveys and extracting host-relevant information. Designed for in-memory execution via `execute-assembly`, it collects data such as system configs, user activity, and security controls to support situational awareness and escalation planning. Its modular checks make it effective for stealthy host recon without touching disk.
