# SharpUp

[SharpUp](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp) is a C# tool designed to replicate key privilege escalation checks from PowerUp in a format suitable for in-memory execution within C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike and Sliver via `execute-assembly`. It focuses on identifying misconfigurations and escalation paths on Windows systems without writing to disk, making it useful for stealthy post-exploitation.
