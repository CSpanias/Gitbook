# Stracciatella

[Stracciatella](https://github.com/mgeeky/Stracciatella) is a C# project that implements the **SharpPick** technique, embedding a PowerShell runspace within a .NET assembly while disabling major defensive mechanisms such as AMSI, ETW, Script Block Logging, Module Logging, and Constrained Language Mode. It provides a hardened PowerShell environment designed for in-memory execution without patching system libraries. Stracciatella emphasizes operational security through ephemeral script handling, XOR-obfuscated parameters, and minimal memory exposure, making it suitable for red team scenarios where stealth and defense evasion are critical.
