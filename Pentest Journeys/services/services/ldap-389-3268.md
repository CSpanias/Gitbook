# LDAP (389, 3268)

LDAP supports three authentication methods:

1. **Anonymous**: The client does not authenticate to the directory. This is equivalent to the anonymous credential level.
2. **Simple**: The client binds to the server by sending itâ€™s DN and password in the clear (all directory servers support this option).
3. **SASL**: This means that the LDAP client and server can be configured to negotiate and use possibly nonstandard and/or customized mechanisms for authentication.
