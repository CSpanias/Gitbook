# 79 - Finger

The [Finger service](https://www.grc.com/port_79.htm) is a legacy network protocol that runs on TCP port `79`. It provides information about users on a remote system, such as login names, full names, and idle times. While largely obsolete today, it was historically used for user lookup and communication, but it poses security risks because it can expose sensitive account information to unauthenticated remote users.

{% tab title="Enum" %}
```bash
# List all users
finger @<target>

# List information about the target user
finger x7331@<target>

# Manual connection
nc <target> 79
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="finger-user-enum" %}
[`finger-user-enum`](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/user-enumeration/finger-user-enum) is a tool for enumerating OS-level user accounts via the Finger service, known to work against the default Solaris daemon as of `v1.0`, though it may not support all daemons due to the lack of a standardized response format.

```bash
finger-user-enum -U anarchy_output -t <target> | grep Login
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
