# 9092 - H2

[H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) is a lightweight, open-source RDBMS written in Java. It is often embedded into applications for testing or development due to its small footprint and ease of deployment, and it supports SQL as well as in-memory and file-based persistence modes. Port `9092` is the default TCP port used by H2 for client-server SQL connections and port `8082` is for its web console.
