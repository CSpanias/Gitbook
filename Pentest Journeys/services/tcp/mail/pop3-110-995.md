# 110,995 - POP3

The **Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3)** is used for **receiving** emails on ports `110` (unencrypted) and `995` (SSL). It downloads messages from the server and **removes them** from it by default. It is good for accessing mail from one device.

```bash
# Connect
telnet <ip> 110
openssl s_client -connect <ip>:995

# Provide your username (email address)
USER <username>

# Provide your password
PASS <password>

# List available email messages (number and size)
LIST

# Retrieve the content of a specific message (e.g., message 1)
RETR 1

# (Optional) Delete a specific message from the server
DELE 1

# Close the connection
QUIT
```
