# 5900 - VNC

**Virtual Network Computing (VNC)** is a graphical desktop-sharing system that allows remote control of another computer over a network. It transmits keyboard and mouse input from the client to the server and relays screen updates back, enabling full remote interaction with the desktop environment. VNC operates on a client-server model and typically uses TCP port `5900`.

```bash
gvncviewer <target>
```
