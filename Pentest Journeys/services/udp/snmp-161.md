# SNMP (161)

**Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** runs over UDP port `161` and is used to monitor and manage network devices like routers and servers. It allows querying for system info (e.g. uptime, CPU, interfaces) and is commonly used in network monitoring tools. If misconfigured—especially with default "public" community strings—it can leak sensitive data or be abused in DDoS attacks.

```bash
# Enumerate SNMP public strings
$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public <target>
```
