Expenditure cycle — step-by-step flow (flowchart summary)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Purchasing

* Department receives an approved purchase requisition (request to procure goods).
* Purchasing prepares the purchase order and identifies a vendor.
* Multiple copies of the same purchase order are produced (not multiple different POs).
* Copies are distributed: vendor, stores, sorted-by-number file, receiving, and accounts payable.
* The purchase requisition copy also goes to accounts payable.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Receiving

* Receiving obtains the purchase order copy from Purchasing.
* They receive and inspect goods, matching received items to the purchase order to verify correctness.
* Receiving prepares a receiving report (proof of what was received).
* Receiving confirms accuracy with other departments as needed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Accounts Payable

* Accounts Payable collects all related documentation (purchase order copies, receiving report, requisition, etc.).
* They match documents to ensure quantities, prices, and approvals tie out.
* AP prepares and approves a voucher to authorize payment.
* Once verified, AP sends the voucher package and documentation to General Accounting and communicates to the Treasurer that payment is due.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Treasurer / Cash Disbursement

* The Treasurer receives the voucher package from Accounts Payable.
* Treasurer reviews the voucher package, prepares the check and remittance advice.
* The person who signs the check last should mail the disbursement checks and remittance advices (AICPA exam point — in theory to prevent post-signature modification).
* General Accounting is updated to reflect cash disbursement (for cash reconciliation) and the canceled/voucher package is stamped/marked paid and filed to prevent duplicate payment.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Notes on separation of duties and practical considerations

* AICPA exam guidance: the employee who signs the check last should mail the checks (prevents modification after signing). In practice, higher-level signers (e.g., treasurer) may delegate mailing to others (secretary/admin). This distinction can be tested on multiple-choice questions.
* Stamping voucher packages "paid" and filing canceled packages prevents duplicate payments and supports audit trails.

the cash dispersement process per the aicpa for the exam an employee in the treasury Department who signs the check last should mail the dispersement checks and remittance advices this is actually a very interesting point I had uh someone talk through this with me who worked in auditing for many decades at just many Industries and many many roles throughout the years uh and right this makes sense in theory the person who signs the check last should mail it because the one who signs it last doesn't want anyone else modifying in it after they've signed it but if we think about that in reality the person who signs a check is usually the treasurer or someone else in a higher ranking position so they wouldn't be taking the time to mail checks and remittance advices they would be giving that off to you know uh someone else secretary or administrative assistant or something so just just so you know this could come up as a question multiple choice question again the person who signs the check last should mail it which makes sense again in theory but in reality quite a little bit different now we're going to take a look at our flowcharts when it comes to the expenditure cycle first we have our purchasing department and from our stores we are going to have our first approved requisition we are going to get it approved to make sure let's say we want to requisition a purchase of uh 10 machines we are going to move that requisition over here we are going to approve and prepare the purchase orders in your purchasing department they are going to then go find a vendor they are going to say hey we want to buy 10 machines from you that's going to create a bunch of different copies of the purchase order as you see here this is not five different purchase orders this is just the five copies of the same purchase order and then requisitions what what does the word word requisition means it means that you want to procure something you want to get something the purchase order is going to go to the vendor obviously the vendor needs to see that in order for you to uh get that purchase order two that's going to go to the stores purchase order three going to be sorted by number purchase order four that's going go to the receiving department which we will see here purchase order five that is going to go to accounts payable they want to keep the records and that requisition is going to go to accounts payable as well now as I said I'm going to redraw that because it was pretty bad we are going to be over here in receiving now this is the receiving department they are going to get that purchase order from the purchasing department they are going to hopefully receive the goods and then match the goods with the purchase order as a check to make sure that you're getting what you actually ordered and then they're going to prepare the receiving report as we' talked about what that is right just proof of what you received and verification that you matched the purchase order with the goods then you are going to take the purchase orders those copies of them and essentially confirm with all these other uh different groups that what we received is completely accurate we're good to go here so far next up we are going to look at the accounts payable department well basically as we mentioned multiple times theon's payable department is going to take every possible uh document and tie them all together make sure they're all adding up you see here this is that step that we've talked about multiple times where they're going to take all related documentation to the purchase and make sure it ties out they're going to match those documents right here they're going to prepare and approve the voucher and verify accuracy and then you know once accounts payable gets their hands on everything they're eventually going to send everything over to General accounting to update the general ledger and then we are going to essentially communicate with the treasurer to say hey you're going to actually have to pay this person then once we get over here to the treasurer we are going to have our voucher package remember we mentioned that here it is with all the documents included in it that's going to come from accounts payable that is going to be sent to the treasurer the treasurer will then review the documentation within the voucher package they're going to prepare the check and their admittance advice remember we've got different perspectives in some cases we're the ones receiving the check and the admittance advice and in this case we are the ones sending a check and that check is going to have remittance advice as well then we are going to essentially send that right we're going to update General accounting we want to let them know hey cash out the door obviously look for that add that to your reconciliation that is now an outstanding check and then we're going to send the canceled voucher package essentially saying like Okay this is stamped we don't want to pay this again right remember that process I mentioned earlier where we don't want to accidentally double pay for something so we stamp it paid canceled we're good that's going to be added to this big file storage for future documentation hey there are you ready to not only pass your CPA exams but truly understand and enjoy the material while studying I know seems impossible right
