welcome to this case study on how a loan officer was able to reach $50,000 plus per month using go high level as a wh label SAS and if you're not familiar with what go high level is then that's primarily what my channel is based on but go high level is basically an all-in-one CRM software something that looks just like this it's a platform that has a bunch of different tools that a small business could need the very unique part about go high level is that they allow you to strip it of all of its branding put your own name and logo on it and actually resell it this concept is called called White labeling and that's exactly what I've done for my own agency so this is what generic high level looks like but if you see over here I've added a different splash of color my logo is in the top leftand corner and my clients get to use my software instead of go high level so this is something that they allow their customers to do and now I want to just take you through a case study of someone who was able to do that very very successfully and the reason I want to do that is not for this to be some sort of expose because I I don't know if it's still taboo to be using go high level white label but just to show you what's possible with this platform and I want to do that for two things one of them is to peel back the curtains to show you what kind of funnels and systems it actually takes to reach levels like this to achieve more than $50,000 a month there's a bunch of different softwares and systems that you would need to set up to be able to reach this level but also a Relentless work ethic as well so I've been obviously doing a deep dive into this specific loan officer who name is Chris Johnstone and I've looked at his content and the the volume that he puts out and it's absolutely no surprise to me that he's been able to achieve this just because he's an absolute workaholic which is fantastic but I want that to serve as inspiration for you I want you to one understand that reaching these levels is absolutely possible because obviously someone here has done it but I've also done it myself to also give you that motivation because I know it can be tough in your journey especially when you're starting out but if you can see what's possible and how others have been able to do it then you can emulate that yourself I also mentioned that I've done this myself so if you're not familiar with who I am my name is Hamza B I go by the automates on social platforms I also run a s figure AI automation agency using go high level and I also won a lot of their Awards back in Dallas at their conference this year so I won their Platinum sasper award putting me at the top 50 out of 60,000 go high level agencies winning the same award as Chris Johnstone that I'm going to talk about in this video as well I also won their AFF filaire award so making me one of I don't know handful of people who are able to win both Awards meaning that I've been able to scale my own agency which is fantastic but also been able to successfully teach others as well so I'm probably one of the few people that you can you know trust and and learn upon on this specific topic which is why I love doing these case studies because these are people at my level and I love to see what they're doing as well and then we can compare funnels and strategies but everything that I'm showing you guys today is public information I haven't actually spoken to him so this is just from a bird's eye view as an outsider looking at their processes so we can understand and emulate these so we can also be successful so just at a high level jumping into his strategy so of course because he is a loan officer his whole marketing and branding and strategy is going to be around that Niche which is obviously fantastic because it's a market that he can speak to very well so he's got a great landing page vssl at the beginning walking you through high level so I don't think they've actually put in a lot of effort to hide the fact that it's high level sure that they've changed the colors and put their logo on it but looking at this at a glance anyone who's used high level before knows that this is exactly high level so I don't think that's why people go to him not because they think it's some other platform but rather that it's probably very niche tailored and he's built upon the high level ecosystem and probably added his own custom built automations and functions and a lot of that you can see over here it's very specific to his Niche and that's why his clientele and his ICP go towards him he's customized it with great detail and then this CRM is also a smaller part of their bigger brand which is called connection Inc so loan officer CRM is one of their products but they do a bunch of other stuff as well so I think that you know they're bigger organization as well offering free consultations so there's there's some waight to that as well now the most important part and what I want to go through is the actual funnel so I want to show you exactly what is feling this growth and how he was able to hit these numbers and just doing a deep dive into his platforms it's all his social media strategy which is honestly amazing he does he does mass mass content creation on social media which is great so starting with YouTube for example YouTube is is very strong so although you might see 4,000 subscribers and you might think that's low but when you're super hyperfocused like this and if if all 4,000 of these people people are somewhat interested in his Niche or if they're loan officers then these videos are going to translate into Dollars very significantly compared to somebody else who's not as hyper Niche maybe they have 50,000 followers they're not making as much money as he is because he's so dialed into his Niche and 900 videos is absolutely no joke as well like I've been posting on YouTube for like a year I only have like 50 videos so for the fact that he has you know that many multitudes of videos Over Me shows that he's just relentlessly putting them out and that's what it takes that level of consistency then moving on to his Instagram same concept right like sure he might have 6,000 followers but if they're all Niche hyper targeted followers then they're going to convert really well and then you can see here that he's got his webinars free trainings Facebook so he's pushing everything here it's all optimized it looks solid he's got a good call to action so these are the kind of things that you have to go so if somebody sees his content Who falls into his ideal customer profile then it's very clear to them what they have to do and what next steps they have to take LinkedIn for his nich loan officers is fantastic that's where all the professionals are that's where they get their leads you can see here that he's advertising himself as the AI guy 10,000 followers on LinkedIn is actually really impressive so that's really cool so he's obviously built up that professional presence so people are going to trust him LinkedIn is great for SEO the other thing which is great is podcast so this is very underrated especially if you're in a niche like like he is where if you got listeners you know who are going to their job every single day working 9: to 5 then they want to listen to people and strategies to help them improve at their work and if no no one else is making loan officer content then he's the only guy that they can listen to so he's going to capture that entire market and I'm not sure how many there are but I imagine that there's tens of thousands of loan officers all across the US so if he has a you know a hold on this Niche then he's going to do really really well the other thing is again I mentioned his work ethic this is you know every 3 days he's pumping out a podcast minus the uh the holiday season so that's that's the level of consistency that it's going to take and again with his Tik Tok as well so his Tik Tok is just going to complement all of the other platforms so he's getting all this traffic he's on all these platforms but what does he do with them he sends them to a landing page and I noticed that most of them link back to the main company landing page and I think the reason for that is that he has some other funnels beyond that too so like I mentioned he's running his courses and webinars so for example he's advertising how to use AI to close more mortgage deals immediately and then obviously you have to op in that he gets your information then he can do retargeting and put you into campaigns to help you close further but courses and webinars are fantastic that's really how people sell a lot of their High ticket programs and then underneath that they've got their private coaching offer which is their executive concierge which he can probably upsell as well but the point is that he's funneling all of this traffic whether you know it's through webinars or private coaching everything leads back to his CRM system that's like the core Foundation of all of his platforms and his teachings where it's like if you want to participate in anything that you have here then loan officer CRM is going to be that essential backbone so he's made it so vital that if anyone wants to participate such his programs you need to have this platform and I think that's exactly what he's done now the key takeaways that you can take from this is that if you are ready to go hyper Niche if you have a niche that you have a ridiculous amount of expertise and experience in like for example if you're a realtor if you're a financial adviser if you've been working in corporate sales anything like that right if you have specialized knowledge and information in any Niche then that should really be what your focus of content is around you should articulate to the world that you are an expert on that subject build up your credibility and your personal brand and then once you have that once people see you as you know the go-to person in your Niche then you funnel all that traffic towards some kind of product it's very easy to funnel people towards go high level I think this CRM is fantastic it pretty much sells itself I would know I'm obviously one of their their top resellers and Affiliates so I know how valuable the software can be but it's all about this traffic component and how can you get people to trust you and that's when you can really really be DED in on some sort of expertise that you have so I hope this video was useful I wanted this to serve as a case study and a sense of inspiration for you to learn more about what's possible with go high level if you want to learn more about actually getting started with go high level you can head over to my

start your go high Lev Journey because honestly it changed my life two years ago once I started creating content I follow a very similar structure to him and I've seen fantastic results there's no doubt that if you had the same level of consistency and you had a solid hyperfocus Niche that you would not kill it as well so let me know in the comments if you like walkthroughs like this and I can
