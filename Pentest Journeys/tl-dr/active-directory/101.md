**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft directory service that enables administrators to manage users, computers, and access to resources across a network. It structures these elements as **objects**—such as users, computers, and groups—each with defined permissions. AD is built on a hierarchical architecture consisting of **Forests**, **Domains**, and **OUs**:

* **Forest**: The top-level container in AD. A forest represents the entire organization and serves as a **security and trust boundary**. It can contain one or more domains and defines the scope of `Enterprise Admin` control.
* **Domain**: A logical grouping of network objects that share the same AD database. Domains have their own **security policies** and **trust relationships**, and each is administered independently. For example, `corp.com` might be a domain in the organization.
* **Organizational Unit (OU)**: A container within a domain used to logically organize objects like users, computers, and groups. OUs facilitate **delegated administration** and the application of **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**. Think of OUs as folders within a domain, often aligned with departments or teams.

A **Domain Controller (DC)** is a central server responsible for managing authentication requests and storing all AD object information. **DNS** is integral to AD's operation, supporting name resolution and service location.

AD also uses **Groups** to streamline access control by assigning permissions collectively to users or systems. Special attention should be given to **privileged groups** like **Domain Admins** (administrative control over a single domain) and **Enterprise Admins** (hold the highest level of privilege, with authority across the entire forest).

In more complex infrastructures, multiple domains can be organized within a **domain tree** or **forest**, allowing for scalability and delegated administration across business units or geographic locations.

{% hint style="info" %}
When using AD credentials, it's best to connect with **RDP** instead of PowerShell Remoting or WinRM. This avoids the [**Kerberos Double Hop**](attacks/delegation/#tl-dr) issue, which can block AD enumeration tools. RDP passes your authentication cleanly, allowing smoother interaction with the domain.
