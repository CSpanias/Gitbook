# Active Directory

**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft service that helps administrators manage users, computers, and access to resources within a network. It organizes these resources into **objects** (like users and computers) that have specific permissions. Objects are grouped into **domains** (e.g., `corp.com`) and structured with **Organizational Units (OUs)**, which act like folders.

A central server called the **Domain Controller (DC)** manages logins and stores information about all objects. AD relies heavily on DNS to operate correctly. **Groups** in AD simplify management by allowing permissions to be assigned to multiple users or systems at once. High-privilege groups like `Domain Admins` and `Enterprise Admins` are key targets for attackers because controlling them means controlling the network.

In larger environments, multiple domains can exist within a **domain tree** or **forest**. Each domain has its own `Domain Admins`, but `Enterprise Admins` can control the entire forest, making them especially valuable to attackers.

When using AD credentials, it's best to connect with **RDP** instead of PowerShell Remoting or WinRM. This avoids the [**Kerberos Double Hop**](attacks/delegation/#tl-dr) issue, which can block AD enumeration tools. RDP passes your authentication cleanly, allowing smoother interaction with the domain.
