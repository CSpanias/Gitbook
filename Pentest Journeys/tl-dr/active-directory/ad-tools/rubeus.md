# Rubeus

[Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) is a post-exploitation tool for interacting with Kerberos on Windows. It enables ticket extraction, ticket creation (Pass-the-Ticket), ticket granting (Ask TGT/TGS), and abuse of Kerberos features like unconstrained delegation and Kerberoasting.
