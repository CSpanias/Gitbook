# Authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
AD authentication uses **NTLM** (legacy) and **Kerberos** (default) protocols. NTLM is vulnerable to brute force; Kerberos uses tickets and session keys but can be abused (e.g., ticket theft). Credentials are cached in **LSASS** memory for SSO, and can be extracted using tools like `mimikatz` if attackers gain `SYSTEM`-level access. Defenses include LSA Protection, disabling WDigest, and endpoint monitoring.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For enumeration or post-authentication interaction, when using AD credentials with tools that rely on impersonation or token delegation, RDP is preferred over PowerShell Remoting or WinRM:

* RDP cleanly passes credentials through the session
* Remoting protocols are impacted by the [Kerberos double-hop limitation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/askds/understanding-kerberos-double-hop/395463).
{% endhint %}

## NTML

**NTLM (NT LAN Manager)** is a legacy authentication protocol that still appears in modern AD environments, particularly in fallback situations, such as when connecting to resources via IP address rather than hostname, or when a service isn’t properly registered in AD DNS. Some third-party applications also continue to prefer NTLM over Kerberos due to compatibility reasons.

1. The client creates an NTLM hash from the user’s password (Step 1) and sends the username to the server (Step 2).
2. The server replies with a randomly generated nonce, aka **challenge** (Step 3).
3. The client sends the **response** (the NTML-encypted nonce) back the server (Step 4).
4. The server forwards the username, nonce, and response to the DC (Domain Controller) (Step 5).
5. The DC uses the stored NTLM hash for that user to encrypt the nonce (Step 6) and if the result matches the response, authentication succeeds (Step 7).

NTML stores unsalted hashed passwords in **SAM** database (`c:\windows\system32\config\sam`) which cannot be copied while the Windows OS is running. **Local Security Authority System (LSASS)** runs with `SYSTEM` privileges and caches NTLM hashes.

> _Although NTLM hashes are non-reversible, the algorithm is very fast, making **brute-force attacks** relatively easy. Despite its weaknesses, NTLM remains in use primarily for compatibility with legacy systems and fallback scenarios._

## Kerberos

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a service is accessed using an IP address instead of a hostname, Kerberos cannot be used and NTLM is forced, often causing authentication to fail if NTLM is not supported or allowed.
{% endhint %}

### Overview

Kerberos is the default authentication protocol (TCP port 88) in modern Active Directory (AD) environments, replacing NTLM since Windows Server 2000. It operates on a ticket-based model and uses a centralized authority, the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The Domain Controller (DC) acts as the KDC within an AD environment.

The core security-related strengths of Kerberos are:

* Users only need to prove their identity once. Thus, sensitive information, such as passwords, is not continually transmitted across the network, which significantly lowers the risk of interception.&#x20;
* Uses time-limited, service-specific, and highly-protected tickets. As a result, even if a ticket is compromised, its limited validity window and scope helps minimise potential impact.

### Simplified Process

The Kerberos authentication process conists of three entities: client, service, and KDC. It also has three main phases: Authentication Service (AS), Ticket Granting Service (TGS), and Application Request (AP). The Kerberos process can be imagined as the process of checking into a hotel and subsequently accessing its various services.

1. AS phase → When a guest (domain account) arrives at a hotel, they first report to reception (KDC) and present some form of official ID, for example, a passport (password). The reception (KDC) verify the guest’s ID and confirm their reservation details. Once this verification is successfully completed, the hotel issues a room key (TGT) which serves as proof that the hotel has authenticated the guest.

```
         Guest Arrives at Hotel (Domain account wants to access AD)
             |
             | Shows official ID (types their password)
             v
      +--------------------+
      | Reception (KDC)    |
      +--------------------+
             |
             | Verifies ID & confirms reservation (Matches the user's hash to its db)
             v
      +--------------------+
      | Room Key (TGT)     |
      +--------------------+
```

2. TGS phase → Let's say that the guest (domain account) wants to access the spa area (MSSQL service). This time, the guest only has to show their room key (TGT) to the reception (KDC), and not their official ID (password). Their room key (TGT) servers as a proof that they have already been verified. The reception (KDC) verify its validity and, if it is confirmed, issue a temporary spa pass (TGS).

```
          Guest (Account) wants spa access (MSSQL service)
              |
              | Shows Room Key (TGT) (instead of password (password))
              v
      +--------------------+
      | Reception (KDC)    |
      +--------------------+
              |
              | Reception (KDC) verifies Room Key (TGT)'s
              | validity & issues temporary Spa Pass (TGS)
              v
      +--------------------------+
      | Temporary Spa Pass (TGS) |
      +--------------------------+
              |
              | Shows temporary Spa Pass (TGS) 
              | at the spa entrance (MSSQL server)
              | & gets access to the spa area (MSSQL service)
```

3. AP phase → The guest (domain account) presents the temporary spa pass (TGS) at the spa entrance (MSSQL service). The latter verifies the authenticity and validity of the pass and, if the pass is valid, grants the guest spa access.

```
          Guest (User) presents Temporary Spa Pass (TGS)
              |
              v
      +---------------------+
      | Spa (MSSQL Service) |
      +---------------------+
              |
              | Spa staff (MSSQL service) verify the validity & 
              | authenticity of the Temporary Spa Pass (TGS)
              v
      +------------------------------------+
      | Spa Access Granted (MSSQL service) |
      +------------------------------------+
```

One key point is that the reception (KDC) treats any guest (domain account) presenting a valid temporary pass (TGS) as already having verified their identity.

## Detailed Process

The Kerberos authentication process works as follows:

1. **User Login (AS-REQ)**\
   When a user logs in, their machine sends an Authentication Service Request (AS-REQ) to the DC (KDC). This request includes a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from the user's password.
2. **KDC Response (AS-REP)**\
   The KDC retrieves the user’s password hash from `ntds.dit` and attempts to decrypt the timestamp. If successful and the timestamp is valid (a duplicate timestamp may indicate a replay attack), the KDC replies with an Authentication Service Reply (AS-REP). This contains a session key (encrypted with the user’s password hash) and a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which is encrypted with the `krbtgt` account’s hash (this is known only to the KDC). The client can decrypt the session key and stores the TGT, which is typically valid for 10 hours and renewable.
3. **Service Request (TGS-REQ)**\
   When the user tries to access a service, the client sends a Ticket Granting Service Request (TGS-REQ) to the KDC. It includes the username, the encrypted TGT, a timestamp encrypted with the session key, and the name of the requested service.
4. **KDC Issues Service Ticket (TGS-REP)**\
   The KDC validates the TGT, checks the timestamp, and ensures the username and IP address match. If everything checks out, it sends a Ticket Granting Service Reply (TGS-REP), which includes a new session key (shared between client and service) and a service ticket encrypted with the service account’s password hash.
5. **Client to Service (AP-REQ)**\
   The client sends an Application Request (AP-REQ) to the service, containing the service ticket, the client’s username, and a timestamp encrypted with the new session key.
6. **Service Validates and Grants Access**\
   The service decrypts the ticket using its own password hash, extracts the session key and username, and verifies the timestamp. If valid, it checks group membership information from the ticket and grants access accordingly.

## Cached Credentials

The **Local Security Authority (LSA)** is a fundamental Windows subsystem responsible for enforcing security policies, managing authentication, and handling credential storage. Its functionality is carried out by the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)** — the `lsass.exe` process — which runs in memory and performs tasks such as logon validation and credential caching.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**OPSEC**: LSASS is the core auth component which makes it the most monitored process on a Windows host!
{% endhint %}

To support Single Sign-On (SSO) and optimize user experience, Windows stores authentication material (e.g., NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, and sometimes plaintext credentials) in the memory of LSASS. When users authenticate (via local login, RDP, `runas`, scheduled tasks, services, etc.), their credential artifacts are stored in LSASS. Although this memory is encrypted and undocumented, with sufficient privileges (typically `SYSTEM`-level), attackers can extract its contents to harvest credentials.

## Credentials Vault

The **Windows Credentials Vault**, also known as Credential Manager, is a secure credential storage mechanism in Windows that retains user credentials for websites, network shares, remote desktop connections, and applications. It enables seamless authentication by allowing the OS and applications to retrieve saved credentials without prompting the user repeatedly.

Stored credentials are encrypted and kept in a protected location on the system. They can be accessed via the Control Panel (Credential Manager UI) or programmatically through the Windows Credential API.

While not as commonly targeted as LSASS, the vault can contain plaintext domain credentials, particularly for scheduled tasks or service accounts. Tools like [Mimikatz](../ad-tools/mimikatz.md) can extract these credentials using commands like `vault::cred /patch`, provided the attacker has elevated privileges.
