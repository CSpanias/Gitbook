# Authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
AD authentication uses **NTLM** (legacy) and **Kerberos** (default) protocols. NTLM is vulnerable to brute force; Kerberos uses tickets and session keys but can be abused (e.g., ticket theft). Credentials are cached in **LSASS** memory for SSO, and can be extracted using tools like `mimikatz` if attackers gain `SYSTEM`-level access. Defenses include LSA Protection, disabling WDigest, and endpoint monitoring.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For enumeration or post-authentication interaction, when using AD credentials with tools that rely on impersonation or token delegation, RDP is preferred over PowerShell Remoting or WinRM:

* RDP cleanly passes credentials through the session
* Remoting protocols are impacted by the [Kerberos double-hop limitation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/askds/understanding-kerberos-double-hop/395463).
{% endhint %}

## NTML

**NTLM (NT LAN Manager)** is a legacy authentication protocol that still appears in modern AD environments, particularly in fallback situations—such as when connecting to resources via IP address rather than hostname, or when a service isn’t properly registered in AD DNS. Some third-party applications also continue to prefer NTLM over Kerberos due to compatibility reasons.

1. The client creates an NTLM hash from the user’s password (Step 1) and sends the username to the server (Step 2).
2. The server replies with a randomly generated nonce, aka **challenge** (Step 3).
3. The client sends the **response** (the NTML-encypted nonce) back the server (Step 4).
4. The server forwards the username, nonce, and response to the DC (Domain Controller) (Step 5).
5. The DC uses the stored NTLM hash for that user to encrypt the nonce (Step 6) and if the result matches the response, authentication succeeds (Step 7).

NTML stores unsalted hashed passwords in **SAM** database (`c:\windows\system32\config\sam`) which cannot be copied while the Windows OS is running. **Local Security Authority System (LSASS)** runs with `SYSTEM` privileges and caches NTLM hashes.

> _Although NTLM hashes are non-reversible, the algorithm is very fast, making **brute-force attacks** relatively easy. Despite its weaknesses, NTLM remains in use primarily for compatibility with legacy systems and fallback scenarios._

## Kerberos

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a service is accessed using an IP address instead of a hostname, Kerberos cannot be used, and NTLM is forced, often causing authentication to fail if NTLM is not supported or allowed.
{% endhint %}

### Overview

Kerberos is the default authentication protocol (TCP port 88) in modern Active Directory (AD) environments, replacing NTLM since Windows Server 2000. It operates on a ticket-based model and leverages a centralized authority called the Key Distribution Center (KDC) (the DC functions as the KDC in AD environments). Kerberos is considered more secure than NTLM, because it ensures that passwords are not transmitted over the network when a user needs to access a service:

* An NTLM hash is tied to a user's session. If compromised, an attacker can access other machines freely via Pass-the-Hash attacks.
* In Kerberos, the user only types their password once. After that, KDC issues service-specific and time-limited "credentials". If compromised, an attacker can only access a specific service during a specific timeframe via Pass-the-Ticket attacks.

### Simplified Process

The Kerberos authentication process has three main entities: a client, a service, and the KDC. It can be thought as the process of checking into and using services at a hotel.

#### 1. Authentication Service (AS)

The primary objective of the AS in Kerberos is to enable a user to establish their identity once and subsequently access multiple services without repeatedly presenting their original credentials.

In this analogy, when a guest arrives at a hotel, they first report to reception and present an official form of identification, such as a passport. The reception staff verify the guest’s identity and confirm their reservation details. Once this verification is successfully completed, the hotel issues a room key which serves as proof that the hotel has authenticated the guest and confirms their authorisation to stay and access the hotel’s facilities throughout their visit, without needing to present their passport again.

```
+-------------------+        +-------------------+
|     HOTEL WORLD   |        |   KERBEROS WORLD  |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+

      Reception   ----------------->   KDC
   (identity check)              (authentication server)

      Passport    ----------------->   Password
   (prove identity)              (user secret)

      Room Key    ----------------->   TGT
   (trusted credential)          (ticket granting ticket)
```

#### 2. Ticket Granting Service (TGS)

If the guest wishes to access a specific service, such as the spa, they do not need to present their passport again. Instead, they return to reception and present their room key. Reception verifies the credential and, if valid, issues a temporary access pass for the requested service. This pass contains relevant details such as the guest’s identity

* The specific service requested
* A validity period
* A security seal confirming it was issued by the hotel

This temporary pass corresponds to the **service ticket** provided by the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) in Kerberos.

***

#### Step 3 – Accessing the service

The guest presents the temporary pass at the spa. The spa staff trust the reception and verify the authenticity and validity of the pass. If the pass is valid, the guest is granted access.

At no point does the spa need to verify the guest’s original identification, as it relies on the hotel’s central authentication authority.

The same process applies for other facilities, such as the gym, restaurant, or pool. Each service requires its own temporary access ticket, obtained using the master guest credential.

***

#### Security benefits

This approach provides several advantages:

* The user’s identity is verified only once.
* Sensitive credentials (such as passwords or identity documents) are not repeatedly exposed.
* Access tickets are time-limited and difficult to forge.
* If a ticket is compromised, its short validity reduces the potential impact.

#### Conceptual mapping

| Kerberos Component            | Hotel Equivalent        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Key Distribution Center (KDC) | Hotel reception         |
| Authentication                | Identity verification   |
| Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)  | Master guest credential |
| Service Ticket                | Temporary access pass   |
| Services                      | Hotel facilities        |





### Detailed Process

The Kerberos authentication process works as follows:

1. **User Login (AS-REQ)**\
   When a user logs in, their machine sends an Authentication Service Request (AS-REQ) to the DC (KDC). This request includes a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from the user's password.
2. **KDC Response (AS-REP)**\
   The KDC retrieves the user’s password hash from `ntds.dit` and attempts to decrypt the timestamp. If successful and the timestamp is valid (a duplicate timestamp may indicate a replay attack), the KDC replies with an Authentication Service Reply (AS-REP). This contains a session key (encrypted with the user’s password hash) and a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which is encrypted with the `krbtgt` account’s hash (this is known only to the KDC). The client can decrypt the session key and stores the TGT, which is typically valid for 10 hours and renewable.
3. **Service Request (TGS-REQ)**\
   When the user tries to access a service, the client sends a Ticket Granting Service Request (TGS-REQ) to the KDC. It includes the username, the encrypted TGT, a timestamp encrypted with the session key, and the name of the requested service.
4. **KDC Issues Service Ticket (TGS-REP)**\
   The KDC validates the TGT, checks the timestamp, and ensures the username and IP address match. If everything checks out, it sends a Ticket Granting Service Reply (TGS-REP), which includes a new session key (shared between client and service) and a service ticket encrypted with the service account’s password hash.
5. **Client to Service (AP-REQ)**\
   The client sends an Application Request (AP-REQ) to the service, containing the service ticket, the client’s username, and a timestamp encrypted with the new session key.
6. **Service Validates and Grants Access**\
   The service decrypts the ticket using its own password hash, extracts the session key and username, and verifies the timestamp. If valid, it checks group membership information from the ticket and grants access accordingly.

## Cached Credentials

The **Local Security Authority (LSA)** is a fundamental Windows subsystem responsible for enforcing security policies, managing authentication, and handling credential storage. Its functionality is carried out by the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)** — the `lsass.exe` process — which runs in memory and performs tasks such as logon validation and credential caching.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**OPSEC**: LSASS is the core auth component which makes it the most monitored process on a Windows host!
{% endhint %}

To support Single Sign-On (SSO) and optimize user experience, Windows stores authentication material (e.g., NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, and sometimes plaintext credentials) in the memory of LSASS. When users authenticate (via local login, RDP, `runas`, scheduled tasks, services, etc.), their credential artifacts are stored in LSASS. Although this memory is encrypted and undocumented, with sufficient privileges (typically `SYSTEM`-level), attackers can extract its contents to harvest credentials.

## Credentials Vault

The **Windows Credentials Vault**, also known as Credential Manager, is a secure credential storage mechanism in Windows that retains user credentials for websites, network shares, remote desktop connections, and applications. It enables seamless authentication by allowing the OS and applications to retrieve saved credentials without prompting the user repeatedly.

Stored credentials are encrypted and kept in a protected location on the system. They can be accessed via the Control Panel (Credential Manager UI) or programmatically through the Windows Credential API.

While not as commonly targeted as LSASS, the vault can contain plaintext domain credentials, particularly for scheduled tasks or service accounts. Tools like [Mimikatz](../ad-tools/mimikatz.md) can extract these credentials using commands like `vault::cred /patch`, provided the attacker has elevated privileges.
