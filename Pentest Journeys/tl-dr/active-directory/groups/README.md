# Groups

When modified a GPO, for the policy changes to take place we will need to force an update (`gpupdate /force`) and then re-login to the target so these changes are reflected to the new session:

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\users\charlotte\Documents> gpupdate /force
Updating policy...

Computer Policy update has completed successfully.

User Policy update has completed successfully.
