# Cert Publishers

The `Cert Publishers` group is a built-in Active Directory group whose members are allowed to publish user certificates to AD objects.&#x20;

However, **they do&#x20;**_**not**_**&#x20;have write access to certificate templates by default**. Granting them such permissions is a **misconfiguration** that can lead to attacks like ESC4.
