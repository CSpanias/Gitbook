# Lateral Movement

**Lateral movement** is how attackers pivot through a network after compromising a single host, using valid credentials or tokens to access other systems and expand control.

<table><thead><tr><th width="186">Technique</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>WMI &#x26; WinRM</strong></td><td>Uses built-in Windows remote management tools to execute commands on remote machines. Requires administrative privileges on the target, and services must be enabled. WinRM typically communicates over HTTP/S (ports <code>5985</code>/<code>5986</code>), while WMI uses DCOM over port <code>135</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PsExec</strong></td><td>A Microsoft tool that remotely launches processes via SMB and the Service Control Manager. Requires SMB (port <code>445</code>), the <code>ADMIN$</code> share, and admin rights on the target. Often used for direct remote shell access.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pass-the-Hash</strong></td><td>Reuses a stolen NTLM hash to authenticate without knowing the actual password. Works only with NTLM-authenticated services like SMB and requires admin rights and access to shares. It enables remote code execution via tools like <code>wmiexec</code> or <code>psexec</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overpass-the-Hash</strong></td><td>Converts an NTLM hash into a Kerberos TGT, letting attackers authenticate to Kerberos services without using NTLM. Tools like <code>mimikatz</code> inject the hash into memory, allowing access to RDP, WinRM, or PsExec using Kerberos instead of hashes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pass-the-Ticket</strong></td><td>Involves stealing and injecting Kerberos TGS tickets, allowing access to specific services as another user. TGS tickets can be reused across systems, even without admin rights, if already present in memory.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DCOM</strong></td><td>Executes remote commands by instantiating COM objects on a target machine. Admin privileges are needed, but it’s stealthy—no files are written to disk.</td></tr></tbody></table>
