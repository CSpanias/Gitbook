# BOLA

{% hint style="success" %}
**BOLA** (_Broken Object Level Authorization_) is a security vulnerability where an attacker can access or modify objects they are not authorized to interact with. This happens because the application does not properly check if a user has the right permissions for each specific object or resource, often due to missing or incorrect authorization checks. Same as [IDOR](../../../web/authorization/idor-bola.md).

[API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)
{% endhint %}

## General Information

Testing for BOLA involves:

1. Identifying relevant requests, i.e., requests that have resources IDs and/or that access other resources.
2. Perform **A-B testing**:
   1. Create and make requests as `userA`.&#x20;
   2. Create `userB` and repeat the requests to `userA`'s resources using `userB`'s token.

## Example

> _The below example is based on the_ [_crAPI_](https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI) _application._

The below example shows how A/B testing works:

1. Two users are created: `userA` and `userB` (Figure 1).

2. We have uploaded a video on `userB`'s profile as well as booked a vehicle.
3. We request the video and car's details with `userB`'s token and we save these requests.
4. We then replace `userB`'s with `userA`'s token and trying to access the same information (Figure 2).

5. We are unable to access the video information (Figure 3), but we are able to access the car's information (Figure 4). The latter is considered a BOLA flaw.
