# Unrestriced Resource Consumption

{% hint style="info" %}
Unrestricted Resource Consumption occurs when an application allows users to consume excessive amounts of system resources (e.g., CPU, memory, bandwidth) without proper limits or controls.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, server crashes, or performance degradation, impacting the availability and stability of the application or system.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement resource limits and quotas for users or requests, use rate limiting and throttling to control resource usage, and monitor system performance to detect and address excessive resource consumption.
{% endhint %}

> _The below example is based on HTB's_ [_API Attacks_](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/api-attacks) _module._

**Lack of limiting user-initiated requests** that consume resources can lead to DoS attacks (Figure 1) as well as BF attacks (Figure 2).

{% hint style="warning" %}
There are  three main issues here:

1. **The backend does not validate that the file size** is within a specified size and since there are **no rate-limiting measures**, an attacker can consume all the marketplace's disk storage.
2. There is **no check of the file extension or content**, which means we can uploiad any file type we want.
3. **The uploaded files are stored within the `wwwroot` directory**. The web API is developed using ASP.NET Core which means that the static files within `wwwroot` are publicly accessible.
