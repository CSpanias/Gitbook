# Unrestriced Resource Consumption

{% hint style="success" %}
**Unrestricted resource consumption** happens when an API does not limit the amount of resources that a user can consume, such as like CPU, memory, or bandwidth. This can lead to DoS (Denial-of-Service) & BF (Brute Force) attacks and/or performance degradation by allowing excessive or abusive resource usage.
{% endhint %}

> _The below example is based on HTB's_ [_API Attacks_](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/api-attacks) _module._

**Lack of limiting user-initiated requests** that consume resources can lead to DoS attacks (Figure 1) as well as BF attacks (Figure 2).

{% hint style="warning" %}
There are  three main issues here:

1. **The backend does not validate that the file size** is within a specified size and since there are **no rate-limiting measures**, an attacker can consume all the marketplace's disk storage.
2. There is **no check of the file extension or content**, which means we can uploiad any file type we want.
3. **The uploaded files are stored within the `wwwroot` directory**. The web API is developed using ASP.NET Core which means that the static files within `wwwroot` are publicly accessible.
