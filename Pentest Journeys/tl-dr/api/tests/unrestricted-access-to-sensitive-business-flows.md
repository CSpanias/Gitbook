# Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

{% hint style="success" %}
**Unrestricted access to sensitive business flows** occurs when APIs allow unauthorized users to access or execute critical business processes or operations. This can expose sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
{% endhint %}

> _The below example is based on HTB's_ [_API Attacks_](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/api-attacks) _module._

The endpoint below reveas the products' discount period which can be exploited by a threat actor by making automated purchases on the starting date and reselling them later at a higher price (Figure 1).
