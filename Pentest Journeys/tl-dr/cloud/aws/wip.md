# WIP

> Based on [Intro to AWS Pentesting](https://courses.hacksmarter.org/courses/90bc8479-b808-4a39-9632-7e97ed4eb72f)

## Tools

### aws

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Enable tab autocompletion in aws
echo -e '\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH\nautoload bashcompinit && bashcompinit\nautoload -Uz compinit && compinit\ncomplete -C "/usr/local/bin/aws_completer" aws' >> ~/.zshrc
```
{% endcode %}

* `accesskey:secret` work like `username:password`
* Created the user `cloudgoat` from IAM and attach the `Admin Access` policy to it
* Then, clicked onto the user and created an access key (`AKIAVUZR3DVG2LOEV4S2`) for CLI usage and it also generated a secret access key

Next, we need to configure the CLI profile:

```bash
$ aws configure --profile cloudgoat
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAVUZR3DVG2LOEV4S2
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: Ew...<REDACTED>...zn
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json

$ export AWS_PAGER=""
# The whoami of aws
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --profile cloudgoat
{
    "UserId": "AIDAVUZR3DVGXPZUMF6XU",
    "Account": "388262206797",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::388262206797:user/cloudgoat"
}
```

### cloudgoat

* [https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat)
* Cloudgoat has different scenarios for practice

Next, we need to configure cloudgoat:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
$ uv run cloudgoat config aws
No configuration file was found at /home/x7331/.local/share/uv/tools/cloudgoat/lib/python3.13/site-packages/cloudgoat/config.yml.
Would you like to create this file with a default aws setting now? [y/n]: y
Enter the name of your default AWS profile: cloudgoat
A default aws setting of "cloudgoat" has been saved.

# Whitelist our IP address
$ uv run cloudgoat config whitelist --auto
No whitelist.txt file was found at /home/x7331/.local/share/uv/tools/cloudgoat/lib/python3.13/site-packages/cloudgoat/whitelist.txt

CloudGoat can automatically make a network request, using https://ifconfig.co to find your IP address, and then overwrite the contents of the whitelist file with the result.
Would you like to continue? [y/n]: y

whitelist.txt created with IP address 10.10.10.10/32
```
{% endcode %}

### pacu

* [https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu)
* Pacu is sort of a Metasploit for cloud

### platforms

* [https://cybr.com/](https://cybr.com/)
