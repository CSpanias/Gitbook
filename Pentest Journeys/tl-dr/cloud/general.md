# General

* In AWS, **access keys function much like traditional usernames and passwords**, granting programmatic entry to services through an access key ID and secret key pair.&#x20;
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM) defines how those credentials are used**. Policies exist in two main forms:&#x20;
  * **Managed policies** are reusable and can be applied across multiple identities
  * **Inline policies** are bound to a specific user or group, providing highly targeted control.&#x20;
* **Roles operate similarly to users but differ in that they do not carry long-term credentials**. Instead, they rely on temporary credentials issued when the role is assumed, making them central to delegated access and lateral movement scenarios.
* Amazon **S3 serves as the cloudâ€™s equivalent of an FTP service**. Data is organized into **buckets**, which act as globally unique top-level containers, and within them, **objects** represent the files or datasets being stored. Access to these resources is governed by several control mechanisms:
  * Identity-based IAM policies (identity-based)
  * resource-based bucket policies (bucket-based)
  * Access Control Lists (legacy)
