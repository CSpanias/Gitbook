# Slack

## 101

Slack is a **cloud-based messaging platform** designed for team communication and collaboration. It allows users to organize conversations into channels, share files, and integrate with external apps and services like GitHub, Jenkins, or Google Drive.

## Attacks

### Exports

Slack, particularly in Enterprise or compliance-focused environments, is known to **redact sensitive information such as credentials in standard exports:**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# winPEAS output
╔══════════╣ Interesting GROUP writable files (not in Home) (max 200)
╚ https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/index.html#writable-files
Group margaret:
/tmp/Test Workspace Slack export May 17 2020 - May 18 2020.zip

# Unzip the file
$ unzip 'Test Workspace Slack export May 17 2020 - May 18 2020.zip' 

# Inspect the JSON file
$ cat secure/2020-05-18.json 
        "text": "I also set you a new password on the Ubuntu box - 69F15HST1CX, same username",
```
{% endcode %}

In such cases, the original unredacted messages are often stored in separate secure JSON files, typically found in paths like `~/.config/Slack/exported_data/secure/`:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
$ cat ~/.config/Slack/exported_data/secure/2020-05-18.json
        "text": "I also set you a new password on the Ubuntu box - TractorHeadtorchDeskmat, same username"
```
{% endcode %}
