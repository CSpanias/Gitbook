Firefox stores saved login credentials within user-specific profile directories, typically found under `.mozilla/firefox/<profile_id>.default`. Within these directories, `logins.json` contains the encrypted credentials, while `key4.db` holds the associated encryption keys required for decryption.

[`firepwd.py`](https://github.com/lclevy/firepwd)  is an open-source Python tool used to decrypt saved Firefox and Thunderbird credentials by processing `logins.json` and `key4.db` (or older formats like `key3.db` and `signons.sqlite`). It performs decryption without relying on the NSS library, supports Firefox versions up to â‰¥75, and is now integrated into the LaZagne project.
