# pspy

## Usage

`pspy` is a CLI tool that monitors running processes without `root` access, revealing executed commands, cron jobs, and more in real time. To use `pspy`, download the appropriate binary for the target Linux system:

* [`pspy32`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy32) / [`pspy64`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64): Large static versions (\~4MB), work on most systems.
* [`pspy32s`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy32s) / [`pspy64s`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64s): Smaller UPX-compressed versions (\~1MB), require libc.

```bash
# Enumerate running processes
$ ./pspy32
```
