# Composer

Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that automates the installation, updating, and autoloading of external libraries used in a project. It allows developers to define project dependencies in a `composer.json` file and ensures consistent environments by resolving and installing compatible package versions. Composer fetches packages from [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/), the default repository, and places them into the `vendor/` directory, alongside an autoloader that integrates them into the application.

In the context of Red Team operations, Composer is a key indicator of a modern PHP project structure. The presence of a `composer.lock` or `vendor/` folder helps fingerprint the application’s internal components and their versions. Misconfigured or exposed Composer files may leak sensitive metadata about the application’s framework, libraries, and potential vulnerable packages, aiding in targeted exploitation.
