# Docker

The [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/) binary is the CLI for interacting with the Docker daemon, which manages containers on the host system. It enables operations such as running, building, inspecting, and managing containers and images. If accessible to a non-root user, it often indicates that the user belongs to the `docker` group, which effectively grants `root`-equivalent privileges.

This is due to the fact that **the Docker daemon runs as** `root`, and containers can be configured to mount the host filesystem, execute binaries with elevated privileges, or [escape into the host environment entirely](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell). In offensive security scenarios, access to the `docker` binary is a high-value target for privilege escalation. It allows spawning containers with mapped volumes, executing custom payloads, or even directly gaining a root shell on the host through intentional container abuse.
