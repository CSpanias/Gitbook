# Gcore

`gcore` is a CLI that creates a core dump of a running process without stopping it. This memory snapshot includes the process’s stack, heap, and loaded libraries, and is useful for **extracting sensitive data** or analyzing execution state during red team operations. It requires the PID of the target process and appropriate permissions. The output (`core.<PID>`) can be examined with tools like `gdb` or simply via `strings` making `gcore` valuable for stealthy, in-memory analysis during post-exploitation.
