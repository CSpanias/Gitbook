# Service Hijacking

Service hijacking is a privilege escalation technique that targets misconfigured or weakly protected systemd service units. When a low-privileged user is **allowed to reload or restart a service running as** `root`, and **has control over the unit file or any executable referenced by it**, arbitrary code execution as `root` becomes possible.&#x20;

This scenario commonly arises when service unit files or scripts are world-writable or owned by the user but executed with elevated privileges. Hijacking a service involves modifying either the service configuration or its executable to trigger payload execution during a `systemctl` restart.

```bash
# Check user's permissions
$ sudo -l

User x7331 may run the following commands on kali:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart backup.service
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
    (ALL) !/bin/bash, !/bin/sh, !/bin/su, !/usr/bin/sudo

# Check the service's status and the service file path
$ systemctl status backup.service
