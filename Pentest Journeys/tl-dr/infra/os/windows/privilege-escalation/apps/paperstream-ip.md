# PaperStream IP

[PaperStream IP](https://www.pfu-us.ricoh.com/scanners/fi/solutions/paperstream-ip) is Fujitsu’s image processing software designed to optimize scanned documents for clarity, searchability, and storage. It operates as a background service that interfaces with TWAIN or ISIS drivers, providing cleanup, enhancement, and conversion of scanned images before they are delivered to applications.

## Local PE

PaperStream IP (TWAIN) version `1.42.0.5685` is affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2018-16156](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16156)) due to unsafe DLL loading in the `FJTWSVIC` service, which runs with `SYSTEM` privileges and processes unauthenticated messages over the `FjtwMkic_Fjicube_32` named pipe. The vulnerable function attempts to load `UninOldIS.dll` and execute an exported function named `ChangeUninstallString`.&#x20;

Since this DLL does not exist in the default installation, an attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name in any directory referenced by the `PATH` environment variable, resulting in arbitrary code execution with `SYSTEM`-level privileges ([PoC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49382)).
