## APIgee

**Apigee** is a platform for developing and managing the full lifecycle of APIs, including traffic management, security, analytics, and monetization. Some indicators that might suggest an API is managed by Apigee are:

1. **Custom Domain**: Organizations often use their own domain names (e.g., `api.company.com`) rather than a domain indicating Apigee.
2. **Path Structure**: While the path structure is customizable, it often follows a versioned format such as `/v1/resource`, `/v2/resource`, etc.
3. **Headers and Metadata**: Sometimes, the presence of specific headers or response metadata might hint at Apigee management, as Apigee might add certain headers for tracking, logging, or security purposes.
4. **API Documentation**: Reviewing the API documentation provided by the organization can reveal that Apigee is being used for API management.
