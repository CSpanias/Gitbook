# What is an API?

**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** allow applications/servers to connect to each other (Figure 1). APIs are **predictable**, i.e., they follow a set structure and they usually return JSON data. APIs differ from traditional websites as the former use **routing** and the latter use **files** (Figure 2).

The most common types are RESTful (**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer) APIs which in layman's terms includes the process of:

1. The client makes a request for some specific data.
2. The server creates an object based on this request.
3. The server sends the "state" of this object as a response to the client.
