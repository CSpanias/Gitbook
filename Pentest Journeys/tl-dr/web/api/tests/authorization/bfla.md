# BFLA

{% hint style="info" %}
Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to functions or endpoints that should be restricted, typically by manipulating request parameters or exploiting insufficient authorization checks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to unauthorized actions or access to sensitive functionalities, potentially compromising security or affecting application integrity.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement strict authorization checks for every function or endpoint, enforce role-based or attribute-based access controls, and regularly audit and test access controls to ensure proper restrictions are in place.
{% endhint %}

## General Information

Testing for BFLA involves the same steps as [BOLA](bola.md); instead of creating and using same permission accounts, such as `userA` and `userB`, we need to have different permission accounts, such as authenticated vs. unauthenticated and/or low-privileged vs. high-privileged.

1. Find functional endpoints that require specific permissions.
2. Login to an account that does not have these permissions.
3. Repeat the requests identified in Step 1 with the account used on Step 2.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_In the case of BOLA the user is authorized to interact with the vulnerable endpoint, whereas in BFLA the user is not._
{% endhint %}
