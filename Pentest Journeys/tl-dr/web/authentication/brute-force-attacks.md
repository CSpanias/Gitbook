# Brute Force Attacks

{% hint style="info" %}
Brute Force Attacks involve systematically trying all possible combinations of credentials (e.g., passwords or encryption keys) until the correct one is found.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to unauthorized access to accounts or systems if strong passwords or protective measures are not in place.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement account lockout mechanisms, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforce strong password policies, and employ rate limiting or CAPTCHA to prevent rapid, repeated login attempts.
{% endhint %}

## Sniper Attack

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Username enumeration via different responses_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses) _lab._

We can perform username enumeration by performing a BFA (Figure 1) and then checking if any of the responses' `Content-Length` stands out (Figure 2).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note that the words `username` and `password` are both 8 characters long. The difference below is based on the words `Invalid` and `Incorrect` . If both used the same word, then we could try a_ [_time-based BFA_](rate-limiting.md)_, as there would be no difference in `Content-Length`._
{% endhint %}

## Clusterbomb Attack

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Username enumeration via subtly different responses_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-subtly-different-responses) _lab._

Instead of brute-forcing the username and the password separately, we can also perform a Cluster bomb attack against both simultaneously (Figure 3).

## Pitchfork Attack

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
ffuf -mode pitchfork -u http://vapi.apisec.ai/vapi/api2/user/login -w emails:EMAIL,passwords:PASS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"EMAIL","password":"PASS"}' -c -fc 401
```
{% endcode %}

## Password Spray

> _The example below is based on TCM's_ [_Practical Bug Bounty_](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-bug-bounty) _course._

This time the web application has an **account lockout policy** that is implement after five failed login attempts (Figure 4).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/web_bfa_passSpray_1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4: The web application's lockout policy.</p></figcaption></figure>

To avoid locking out accounts, instead of brute-forcing the login page, we can perform a **password spray attack** by using a username list, such as the [top-usernames-shortlist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt), with just four common passwords at a time taken from a list such as [best15.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best15.txt). This will result in four login attempts for each account, one shy of lockout (Figure 5).&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Typically, the lockout policy resets after a period of time, thus, we would have to wait for it before trying the next set of four passwords. In this case, we can just reset the database by visiting the `/init.php` directory.
{% endhint %}

Repeating the password spray attacking using the third set of passwords, we successfully log in as `admin` (Figure 6).
