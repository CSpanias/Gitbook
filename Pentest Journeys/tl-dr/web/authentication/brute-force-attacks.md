# Brute Force Attacks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Brute Force Attacks** (_BFAs_) involve attackers systematically guessing combinations of usernames and passwords. By analyzing system responses, they can identify valid credentials, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts. This exploitation often relies on observing different responses to correct and incorrect guesses.
{% endhint %}

## Username Recon

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Username enumeration via different responses_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses) _lab._

We can perform username enumeration by performing a BFA (Figure 1) and then checking if any of the responses' `Content-Length` stands out (Figure 2).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note that the words `username` and `password` are both 8 characters long. The difference below is based on the words `Invalid` and `Incorrect` . If both used the same word, then we could try a_ [_time-based BFA_](rate-limiting.md)_, as there would be no difference in `Content-Length`._
{% endhint %}

### Username Recon 2

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Username enumeration via subtly different responses_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-subtly-different-responses) _lab._

Instead of brute-forcing the username and the password separately, we can also perform a Cluster bomb attack against both simultaneously (Figure 3).
