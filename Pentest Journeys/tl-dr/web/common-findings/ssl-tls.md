# SSL/TLS

{% hint style="info" %}
**Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security** (**SSL/TLS)** **testing** is the process of evaluating the security and configuration of SSL/TLS  protocols on a web server, making sure that data transmitted over the internet is encrypted and secure. It typically involves **checking certificate validity** (correctly installed and not expired), **reviewing** **configuration** (strong encryption algorithm and protocol usage), and **vulnerability scanning** (susceptibility against known attacks).
{% endhint %}

## Tools

{% hint style="info" %}
We can use tools, such as [Qualys Online test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) or Burp Suite's [SSL Scanner](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/474b3c575a1a4584aa44dfefc70f269d) extension to quickly check for SSL/TLS issues.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Check OWASP's [best practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#server-configuration) and/or individual ciphers on [CipherSuite](https://ciphersuite.info/) by copying their RFC name.
{% endhint %}

{% tab title="nmap" %}
```bash
nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 www.example.com
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="sslyze" %}
[`sslyze`](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze) can analyze the SSL/TLS configuration of a server by connecting to it, in order to ensure that it uses strong encryption settings and that it is not vulnerable to known TLS attacks:

```bash
sslyze --regular example.com:443
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="testssl" %}
&#x20;[`testssl`](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh) is a free CLI tool which checks a server's service on any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some cryptographic flaws:

```bash
testssl owasp.org
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="O-Saft" %}
[`o-saft`](https://github.com/OWASP/O-Saft) lists information about remote target's SSL certificate and tests the remote target according given list of ciphers:

```bash
o-saft.pl +check +vulns example.tld
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="sslscan2" %}
&#x20;[`sslscan2`](https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan) is a TLS/SSL scanner that checks supported protocols, cipher suites, and configurations, including TLS 1.3, to identify security weaknesses in SSL-enabled services:

```bash
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
