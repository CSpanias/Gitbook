# XSS

{% hint style="info" %}
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, typically through input fields or URL parameters.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to the theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data, and can also allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the user or deface web pages.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Sanitize and escape user inputs, use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and validate input on both client and server sides to prevent unauthorized script execution.
{% endhint %}

There are mainly two XSS classifications:

1. Based on the level of the payload's persistence: [Reflected](reflected.md) vs. [Stored](stored.md).
2. Based on which location the payload is outputted: Server vs. [Client](dom-based.md) (aka DOM-based).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* [Don't use `alert()`](https://portswigger.net/research/alert-is-dead-long-live-print), but rather `print()` or `prompt()`.
* Check for HTML injection first and then for XSS.
{% endhint %}
