# Stored

{% hint style="info" %}
Stored XSS is a type of Cross-Site Scripting where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and then served to users who view the stored content.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to persistent attacks, where the malicious script runs every time the stored content is accessed, potentially stealing user data, performing actions on behalf of users, or defacing the website.
{% endhint %}

## Basic

> _The example below is based on TCM's_ [_Practical Bug Bounty_](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-bug-bounty) _course._

This application just allows to post comments. We can start by checking if the target is vulnerable to HTML injection before testing straight for XSS (Figure 1).

Next, we want to test for Stored XSS. The easiest way to do this is by using [Firefox's Multi-Account Containers extension](../../authorization/automated-a-b-testing.md#multi-account-containers), create an XSS payload with `UserA`, and then visit the page with `UserB` to see if the payload is executed (Figure 2).

## href Attribute

> The example below is based on PortSwigger's [_Stored XSS into anchor `href` attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-href-attribute-double-quotes-html-encoded) lab.

In this application there is a comment functionality which also includes a `Website` field. The value of this field is stored within the HTML `href` attribute (Figure 1).

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/web_xss_stored_1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Identifying potential XSS vectors.</p></figcaption></figure>

We can try escaping the tag with payloads such as :

```javascript
"><script>alert()</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert()>
```

Unfortunately, neither of the above payloads work. However, the `href` attribute can itself create a scriptable context, thus, we are not required to escape it. In this case, we can use the `javascript` pseudo-protocol directly (Figure 2).

```javascript
javascript:alert()
```
