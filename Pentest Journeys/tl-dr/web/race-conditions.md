# Race Conditions

{% hint style="success" %}
A **race condition** vulnerability occurs when the outcome of a process depends on the timing or sequence of events, allowing attackers to manipulate the process to achieve unintended or unauthorized results. This can lead to data corruption, unauthorized access, or other security issues.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

### Limit Overrun

{% hint style="success" %}
One-time use actions, such as redeeming a coupon, rating a product, or withdrawing money. The exploitation process is the following:

1. Find a single-use endpoint
2. Send multiple requests to see if the limit can be overrun
{% endhint %}

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Limit overrun race conditions_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions/lab-race-conditions-limit-overrun) _lab._

The application has a field for inserting a coupon at checkout as well as current coupon that gives us 20% off (Figure 1).

The server prevents coupon abuse, i.e., the same coupon being applied multiple times, when sending the requests sequentially (Figure 2).

We can try testing for a race condition vulnerability by replicating the same request multiple times and sending all simultaneously (Figure 3).

### Single-Endpoint

{% hint style="success" %}
Focusing on an endpoint that has some security impact, such as password reset, account creation, account verification, etc. The goal is to trigger a collision that demonstrates impact rather than just getting requests in before the race window closes.
{% endhint %}

First, we need to understand how the update email process works (Figure 5).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/web_race_cond_4.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Stepping through the update email functionality.</p></figcaption></figure>

We can test if a collision is possible by sending multiple requests at the same time using different user emails (Figure 6).

Next, we can try to achieve the required collision (Figure 7) and when it does (Figure 8), refreshing the application page will give us access to the admin panel .

### Multi-Endpoint

{% hint style="success" %}
Testing a series of actions that make up the application flow or business logic. For example, the checkout, the time it takes to verify a payment, and the confirmation. Could we add more items to the basket during this window between checkout and confirmation?
{% endhint %}
