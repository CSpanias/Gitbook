# Race Conditions

{% hint style="success" %}
A **race condition** vulnerability occurs when the outcome of a process depends on the timing or sequence of events, allowing attackers to manipulate the process to achieve unintended or unauthorized results. This can lead to data corruption, unauthorized access, or other security issues.
{% endhint %}

## Examples
