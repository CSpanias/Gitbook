# 101

SSRF vulnerabilities occur when the applications process and generate a request based on user-supplied input. Essentially, an SSRF flaw allows attacker to use the application as a proxy server. Interacting with the **loopback interface** can result to accessing ports that are externally inaccessible.

## Testing for SSRF

## Exploiting SSRF

### Instance Metadata in Cloud

Many cloud providers have internal services that provide configuration metadata to the hosted VMs, which may include SSH public keys. AWS uses the link-local address `169.254.169.254` for their metadata services. GCP uses `metadata.google.internal` which may include private credentials.

Metadata services allow modifications to metadata via `POST` or `PUT` requests. If we only have access to a `GET` request, we will only be able to read metadata values. However, if we are able to update metadata, we may be able to gain access to the environment by adding our own SSH key to the list of allowed public keys.

### Bypassing Authentication in Microservices

Applications running in containers or as microservices will often have fewer security controls. Instead, they rely upon other systems, such as an API gateway or a reverse proxy, to provide security controls before forwarding traffic to the application.

If we can exploit a SSRF flaw in an application or microservice behind the security controls and make it talk directly to another microservice, we can potentially bypass the security controls of the latter. In other words, any security controls enforced by an API gateway on traffic entering the internal network would not apply to the traffic between the two microservices since the traffic originates within the internal network.

### Alternative URL Schemes

Depending on the user-agent that generates the forged request, we might be able to use protocols other than `HTTP`, such as the `file` scheme which allows us to reference files on the target server.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Python Requests library does not support the `file` scheme, but `curl` does.
{% endhint %}

A valid file URI requires a host and a path. However, we can omit the host value by using `/` that indicates there is not hostname (`file:/tmp/foo.txt`) or `///` to indicate an empty hostname (`file:///tmp/foo.txt`).

Some user agents, such as `curl`, support the [`Gopher`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher\_\(protocol\)) protocol, which can be used to bypass some of the restrictions of a traditional SSRF flaw. This allows newline characters in URLs.
