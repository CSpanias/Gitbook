# Passwords

* CLI tools, such as `hashcat` and `john`, **compute hashes on the fly using wordlists and rules**. They hash each candidate and compare it to your target, which takes time depending on hardware, wordlist size, and rules. This means that **they can only crack a hash if its plaintext equivalent is within the worldlist used**.
* Online tools, such as [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/), use **precomputed hash databases** (rainbow tables). When you enter a hash it simply looks it up â€” no cracking needed. Instant results if the hash is known.
