# awk

## Basic Filtering

By default, it treats spaces/tabs as delimiters. This can be changed using `-F'<del>'`.&#x20;

```bash
# extract the first field
awk '{print $1}' <file>
# extract multiple fields
awk '{print $1,$4}' <file>
```

## Line Filtering

`$NF` (number of fields) represents the last field, while `$NR` (number of records) represents the total number of records.

```bash
# start from the 3rd line and print the last field.
awk 'NR > 3 {print $NF}' <file>
```
