## awk

Start from the 3rd line and print the 5th field.

```bash
awk 'NR > 3 {print $5}'
```

## grep

Extract whatever comes after `Host:` .

* `o` prints only the matched parts of the line and not the entire line.
* `P` activates Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE), in this case,`\K`:. This is a special feature in Perl-compatible regular expressions that **resets the starting point of the match**, that is, only the characters after `\K` will be included in the output.

```bash
grep -oP 'Host:\s*\K[^\s;]*' "${NMAP_FILE}"
```
