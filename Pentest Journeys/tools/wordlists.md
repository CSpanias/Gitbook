# Wordlists

## Usernames

[`username-anarchy`](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) is a tool for generating realistic username lists based on common naming patterns:

```bash
# Create username combinations based on the first and last name
username-anarchy -i site_users > user_anar

# Combine wordlists
cat userList >> user_anar

# Deduplicate wordlist
sort -u user_anar > users
```

## Spider-Based

[`cewl`](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) is a custom wordlist generator that spiders a target website to extract unique words for use in user enumeration and password cracking:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use the IP address of the server and not the local DNS hostname. If the latter is used, `cewl` won't be able to crawl from the homepage as the source code of it would refer to other pages by the IP address.
{% endhint %}

```bash
cewl --write output.txt http://kali/manual
```
