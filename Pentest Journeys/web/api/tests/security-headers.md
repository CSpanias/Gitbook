# Security Headers

> Based on OWASP's [Rest Security Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers).

The following headers are **recommended for all API responses**:

| Header                                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cache-Control: no-store`                         | Prevents the browser and any intermediaries from caching the response. Ensures sensitive data isn’t stored and each request gets fresh data. |
| `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` | Blocks the API response from being embedded in frames or iframes, protecting against clickjacking.                                           |
| `Content-Type`                                    | Specifies the correct type of content and prevents the browser from guessing and misinterpreting the response type (MIME sniffing).          |
| `Strict-Transport-Security`                       | Forces the browser to use HTTPS for future requests to the domain, protecting against downgrade attacks and insecure connections.            |
| `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`                 | Ensures the browser respects the declared `Content-Type` and doesn’t attempt MIME sniffing.                                                  |
| `X-Frame-Options: DENY`                           | Similar to `frame-ancestors`, it blocks the response from being framed, offering clickjacking protection.                                    |

The following headers mainly **enhance security for HTML responses**:

<table><thead><tr><th width="223">Header</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></td><td>Primarily affects HTML pages by controlling what content can be loaded. Not useful for APIs that don’t return HTML.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Permissions-Policy</code></td><td>Controls access to browser features. Useful mostly in browsers rendering HTML. Can still be applied broadly as a safeguard.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Referrer-Policy</code></td><td>Controls what referrer information is sent with requests. Has minimal impact on non-HTML responses, but safe to include.</td></tr></tbody></table>
