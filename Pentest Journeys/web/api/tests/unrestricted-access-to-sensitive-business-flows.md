# Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

{% hint style="info" %}
Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows occurs when users can access or manipulate sensitive business processes or functionalities without appropriate authorization or access controls.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to unauthorized actions, data exposure, or financial loss, as users might perform operations or access information beyond their intended privileges.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement strict access controls and authorization checks for sensitive business processes, validate user permissions before allowing access to critical functionalities, and regularly review and audit access policies and roles.
{% endhint %}
