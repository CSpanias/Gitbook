# Unsafe API Consumption

{% hint style="info" %}
Unsafe API Consumption occurs when an application or service interacts with APIs in a way that exposes it to vulnerabilities, such as not validating inputs or failing to handle sensitive data securely.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to security issues such as data breaches, unauthorized access, or exploitation of API-related vulnerabilities.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement strong input validation and sanitization, use authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensure secure handling of sensitive data, and regularly review and test API interactions for potential security flaws.
{% endhint %}

> _The below example is based on HTB's_ [_API Attacks_](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/api-attacks) _module._

This flaw is present when an API consumes another API in an insecure manner, for instance, a 3rd party endpoint vulnerable to [Excessive Data Exposure](excessive-data-exposure.md) (Figure 1).
