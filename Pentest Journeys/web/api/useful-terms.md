## APIgee

**Apigee** is a platform for developing and managing the full lifecycle of APIs, including traffic management, security, analytics, and monetization. Some indicators that might suggest an API is managed by Apigee are:

<table><thead><tr><th width="226" align="right">Indicator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right"><strong>Custom Domain</strong></td><td>Organizations often use their own domain names (e.g., <code>api.company.com</code>) rather than a domain indicating Apigee.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Path Structure</strong></td><td>While the path structure is customizable, it often follows a versioned format such as <code>/v1/resource</code>, <code>/v2/resource</code>.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Headers and Metadata</strong></td><td>Sometimes, the presence of specific headers or response metadata might hint at Apigee management.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>API Documentation</strong></td><td>Reviewing the API documentation provided by the organization can reveal that Apigee is being used for API management.</td></tr></tbody></table>
