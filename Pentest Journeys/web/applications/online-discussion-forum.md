# Online Discussion Forum

## 101

An Online Discussion Forum is a **web-based platform** where users can post messages, ask questions, and engage in threaded conversationsâ€”typically organized by topic. It allows for asynchronous communication and knowledge sharing among communities. While less popular today due to the rise of real-time tools like Discord or Slack, forums are still widely used in niche communities, open-source projects, and support sites.

## Attacks

The Online Discussion Forum Site `1.0` application suffers from an [**unauthenticated** **RCE** vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48512) due to **improper file upload handling**. During user registration (`/register.php`), attackers can upload a malicious `.php` shell, which is then placed in a web-accessible directory (`/ups/`).
