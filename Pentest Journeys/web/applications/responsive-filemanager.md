# Responsive Filemanager

Responsive FileManager is a web-based file management plugin designed to integrate with rich text editors like TinyMCE or CKEditor. It provides an interface for uploading, browsing, renaming, and managing files and directories on the server through a browser. This tool is commonly used in content management systems (CMS) and custom web applications to allow users or administrators to handle media assets and documents. When improperly configured or left unpatched, it can expose sensitive file operations directly to the web, making it a potential attack surface during a web application assessment.

## LFI

Version `9.13.4` and earlier has improper input validation on the `path` parameter. This allows attackers with a valid session (**authenticated** access) to perform **directory traversal** by injecting relative path sequences such as `../../..`, effectively escaping the intended file browsing directory and accessing arbitrary files on the server.&#x20;
