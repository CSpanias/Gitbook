# PHP strcmp

The [`strcmp()`](https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_strcmp.asp) function in PHP is used to compare two strings in a binary-safe manner. If strings are:

* identical → returns `0`&#x20;
* first string > second string → positive number&#x20;
* first string < second string → negative number

When improperly implemented in authentication logic, this function can be abused due to PHP’s **type juggling** behavior which refers to the **automatic conversion that PHP performs when comparing values of different types**. Instead of strictly enforcing type equality, PHP tries to convert one or both values to a common type before making the comparison.

This behavior can lead to unexpected results, especially when **loose comparison operators** like `==` are used. For example, when comparing `NULL` and `0` with `==`, PHP treats them as equal because both are considered "empty" or "falsey" values after type conversion. This implicit conversion can create vulnerabilities if a developer assumes strict type checks without using strict comparison operators (`===`), potentially allowing attackers to bypass security checks by exploiting these type coercions.

As a result, **supplying an empty array as an argument causes** `strcmp()` **to return** `NULL`, and in loose comparisons, `NULL == 0` evaluates to true. If the developer checks the `strcmp()` return value using a loose comparison against `0`, the authentication condition may pass even when the provided input is not the correct password.

In the below scenario, sending `$_POST['password']` as an empty array (`password[]=""`) results in `strcmp()` returning `NULL`, which in a loose comparison is treated as equal to `0`. This allows bypassing the password check entirely and gaining unauthorized access.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```php
if($_GET['login'] === "1"){
    if (strcmp($_POST['username'], "admin") == 0 && strcmp($_POST['password'], $pass) == 0) {
        echo "Welcome! </br> Go to the <a href=\"dashboard.php\">dashboard</a>";
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
