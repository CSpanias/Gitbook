# IDOR / BFLA

{% hint style="info" %}
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) is a vulnerability where attackers can access or perform actions on objects or functions they are not authorized to by manipulating request parameters or URLs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This can lead to unauthorized access to resources, data exposure, or unintended actions being performed by exploiting inadequate authorization checks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Implement robust access controls and authorization checks for every request, ensure proper validation of user permissions, and avoid exposing sensitive object references or functionality directly.
{% endhint %}

> _The example below is based on PostSwigger's_ [_Unprotected admin functionality_](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality) _lab._

Burp's Active Scan reveals an exposed `robots.txt` file which reveals the `/administrator-panel` directory (Figure 1).

This directory gives us direct access to administrative functionalities (Figure 2).
