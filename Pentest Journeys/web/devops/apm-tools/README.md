# APM Tools

**Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools** are software solutions designed to track and analyze the performance and availability of applications in real time. They collect data on metrics such as response times, throughput, error rates, and resource usage, enabling developers and operators to quickly identify bottlenecks, diagnose issues, and optimize application health and user experience. APM tools provide detailed insights into how applications behave under different conditions, supporting proactive maintenance and faster troubleshooting.
