# Personal Pentesting Knowledge Base
## 👋 Welcome!

This repository hosts the content for my personal GitBook knowledge base, a continuously evolving collection of hands-on experience, study notes, and practical insights from various cybersecurity platforms and learning resources.

> 🛠 Work in Progress  
This site is actively being updated with new content derived from labs, courses, real-world work, and research.

## 🧭 About This Project
This GitBook is designed as a centralized personal knowledge hub. It consolidates learning from platforms like:
- Hack The Box (HTB)
- TryHackMe (THM)
- Offensive Security (OffSec)
- TCM Security
- PortSwigger
- APISEC
- Open University (OU)

It contains:
- Detailed walkthroughs of challenges and labs
- Theory snippets on core pentesting concepts
- Practical tool usage notes from offensive security engagements

The goal is to document and organize everything I’ve learned through courses, certifications, labs, and real-world pentesting work — making it easier to review, share, and build upon.

## 📚 Sections
- Walkthroughs — Step-by-step breakdowns of boxes, labs, and challenges
- Theory Snippets — Concise notes on key pentesting concepts and commands
- Tool Usage — Practical guides and usage tips for common offensive security tools
